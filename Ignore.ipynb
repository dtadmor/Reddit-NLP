I&amp;#39;ve added a photo of the final board of our last play through. Can someone please help us understand how the farms would be/should be counted?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/G0EBEMN\"&gt;https://imgur.com/G0EBEMN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "     'selftext': \"Hey everyone.\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\nI'm working on a 4X boardgame. So far only in the ideation phase. To be as informed as possible I've begun reading more game rule books, not only for 4X games but that is my main interest. I've been around boardgames for several years and I think I have seen most games that are not too obscure or rare so to speak. From what I know of Clash of Cultures is the game that reminds one the most of my concept so naturally I've read that one, unfortunately haven't had a chance to play it yet. My game has resource collecting, area control, covert operations, battles and tons of unique upgrades through a set of different districts that the player can build. Small note, the majority of them are not the simple +1 type.\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\nOut of the pure 4X genre I just started reading the Eclipse SD rule book and I will of course read Twilight Imperium 4E, though that game is likely way more complex but probably still very informative.\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\nAnyway, what rulebooks would you recommend for 4X or related ones? Pseudo 4X games like Scythe, already played it, is fine too. Or just a rulebook of a game in general you think is important reading, likely related to area control or upgrades etc. A small note though, I don't like dice driven games so I would prefer if you would omit such games, thank you. But! If it's a 4X game with dice resolution that is important reading to me anyway!\\n\\n\\u200b\\n\\nThanks everyone! Regards / beatspores\",\n",

       "     'selftext': \"https://imgur.com/gallery/XSUqgZR\\n\\nHey boardgamers! My girlfriend and I love playing board games together. As much as we love the less mainstream stuff, Monopoly is her favorite. So, I designed and built her a Monopoly board with a secret trapdoor which contained the ring box. I invited a bunch of friends over and showed her the board. We didn't play a full game; the intention was for it to be more presentational. She rolled some trick dice which I also made (one was all fours, one all threes), landed on chance, pulled a card that directed her to the secret compartment and told her how to open it, and there was the ring!\\n\\nThis idea was inspired by a post I saw on reddit about 4 years ago. I don't remember the redditor's name, but I know his imgur handle is justinlebon26. Credit where it's due.\",\n",

My girlfriend and I love playing board games together. As much as we love the less mainstream stuff, Monopoly is her favorite. So, I designed and built her a Monopoly board with a secret trapdoor which contained the ring box. I invited a bunch of friends over and showed her the board. We didn&amp;#39;t play a full game; the intention was for it to be more presentational. She rolled some trick dice which I also made (one was all fours, one all threes), landed on chance, pulled a card that directed her to the secret compartment and told her how to open it, and there was the ring!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This idea was inspired by a post I saw on reddit about 4 years ago. I don&amp;#39;t remember the redditor&amp;#39;s name, but I know his imgur handle is justinlebon26. Credit where it&amp;#39;s due.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",
