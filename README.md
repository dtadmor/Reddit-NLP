# Board Games and Video Games
## Understanding Different Languages

The goal of this project was to better understand the board gaming and video gaming communities by determining the differences in their word choice. Using the Reddit API, I retrieved over 5,000 posts on board games and video games. I vectorized the words from those posts using TFIDF. From there, I optimized different classifiers for the data. The best classifier was able to determine subreddits with 98% accuracy. Using it, I could determine which words were the best predictors of each subreddit.
