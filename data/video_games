I've been there done that with a incredible PC I could run everything on max with. Now I just have both consoles (besides switch will I'll be grabbing soon for smash) which cost me less, lasted longer and I have WAY more fun with, I personally much prefer a controller and a system created for gaming. At the end of the day, its personal preference. And the reality is after sony gets theirs heads out of their asses(I play ps4 89% of the time still but bless their souls) we will all be gaming together on most games in the future. In my opinion, everyone's opinion is valid, game on whatever you want. It's time to show the world were all gamers no matter what you play or play on.

Unfortunately, I've seen a couple big boss fights in DS3 on youtube (though my memory is hazy on who and I have no clue how to beat them) so I'm worried I'm a little spoiled on some of the boss fights. I also heard somewhere that the guy you play as was a Lord of Cinder who failed, is that a major spoiler? I played it up until  I beat the giant tree boss battle and then sold my xbox and built a pc. I looked on steam and saw that DS2:SotFS was dirt cheap so I went ahead and picked it up. I played that game for a while but I went on a gaming hiatus and haven't gotten back into it yet. I didn't make it to any of the four big bosses in DS2. I think the last place I was at in 2 was a windmill. I have never played or seen anything in the original DS unless that one super hard two-on-one boss fight is in 1, but I'm not even sure that fight is in the first one. All I know is that I LOVED the combat and lore in the parts I've played. I have 3 questions for you DS experts and hope you can answer them.

&amp;#x200B;

1:  I want to restart DS 2 and 3 but I'm not sure how deep I was into them. Was I deep enough into the games that restarting is a bad idea?

&amp;#x200B;

2: Were the boss fights in DS3 ruined because I've seen a couple clips of them. Although, like I said, I don't remember which fights I saw and I DEFINITELY don't remember how to beat them. Just worried I won't have that same surprise when I see a boss for the first time.

&amp;#x200B;

Dark souls 3 bosses won’t spoil because you don’t know exactly when they’ll pop up so you’ll have an ‘oh shit’ and ‘ahhhh that’s where you are’ moment. 
I absolutely loved the trilogy and got started through DS3. However since DS3 does have a lot of connection to DS1
I’d say
1,2,3 
Because it will truly feel like one massive story and 3’s end will be lovely and perfect 1. Players start and re-start DS all the time to try out different sets, so it's not a big deal, I'm sure once you get into it you'll catch up to your previous file pretty quickly. 
2. Even if you have seen the bosses, it doesn't take away from the experience of fighting them yourself, or more specifically, beating them yourself after many tries. So satisfying!
3. The games don't really have a chronilogical story as far as I'm aware (not so clearly that it'll affect you while playing) so play whichever order you want. Players generally seem to say 1 and 3 are the best. 
4. If you have a PS4, don't forget Bloodborne! Not the same series, but same engine/game devs, so if you like DS, you'll probably like Bloodborne too. "

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",0.0,,False,7.0,False,4.0,What are your favorite nostalgic video games?,False,"I’ve been collecting game systems for the last four years and playing for about fifteen years. I currently have eight different systems including a Nintendo 64, PlayStation 1, and Sega Genesis. My favorite nostalgic system is probably the PS1 because of the Spyro and Crash Bandicoot games, Spyro: Year of The Dragon is one of my all time favorites. Besides those I play/ed a lot of Final Fantasy VII and Tony Hawk. On my Nintendo 64 I absolutely love Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards and Mario 64, of course. However, Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Majora’s Mask are two of my all time favorites. Last, for Sega, I just really love all of the Sonic games, but Street Fighter and Castlevania are some other great classics. 

I looooove video games and find that it really helps my anxiety :) Destroy all humans, Spyro the dragon PS1Aaron from the Critical Twits here. Some great suggestions above. All games I've gone back to in the past, especially when I've needed a pick me up. We even went back to a couple on a series we had on our YouTube channel.
Parasite Eve on the PS1 is a definite favourite. Musical score is stunning, mix of real time and turn based combat, and an engaging (if kind of B movie) story. Graphically was stunning (and disgusting) at the time.
Phantasy Star Online (GameCube version, as I missed the Dreamcast window) is...kind of mindless? But works for me because it's not over complicated and you always feel like your accomplishing something. The audio and music are great as well.
I have to admit, there's something about the audio cues on older games I played that works for reducing anxiety. Stick on the Sonic or Soul Reaver soundtrack and I'm nearly instantly relaxed. Even hearing the menu sounds from PSO or FFVII has that effect!"

J. Jonah Jameson here.

Lock the cellar. Batten the hatches. Buy your wife a bugspray and listen up because I've got news, people. The sort you oughta know. That web-faced, wall-crawling freakshow's on the rise again. According to trusted sources, New York City's scuttling scourge, peacock vigilante, Spider-Man, no doubt plans resumption to his brand of Manhattan ""heroics"" as early as week's end! This, following a yearslong hiatus, during which the lot of us optimistic folk thought that Web-head flat out Web-dead.

If only.

When footage first broke two years back, I bet it phoney-baloney Photoshop nonsense. Computer made; just to stir up trouble, views, pointless debate. That's all I'd grant those pansy pandering falsofiers over at Insomniac Nightly News. After all, their last viral scoop was what? A space cat with a talking backpack? Give me a break. Looney McLoser hadn't spun so much as a Central Park hammock in all the years since Captain Beenox and Dr. Activision justly beat the sucker silly. Now, suddenly, he's been posing pretty for exactly one network and the shots are cleaner than Parker's best day at The Bugle? Impossible!

Except, disappointing as it was, the video department at ESU did confirm authenticity - everything but the supposed ""happenchance"" context of the footage. My theory? INN struck a deal. They must have promised that bug braggart toady batches of weekly scarlet boot-licking airtime in exchange for becoming the central hub of this nation's next meteoric rise in ad-revenue rich idiocracy! It's exactly what they needed. A bizzaro underdog anthem to cheat up their theatrics, match their mania, and bulldoze every other story on the market.

For the record: We at The Daily Bugle would never knowingly conduct business with super-beings for profit.

But let's stay on topic.

That splashy spandex moron is about to mount yet another scheme to plunge this city into an Arachnophobic Armageddon. Just yesterday, exiting an Uber-cab, I even saw the beginnings of it myself, hanging there. Sticky. Tangled. Obnoxiously silver. The one method of vandalism, both private and public, that neither sector has ever managed to prevent. Yet Mr. They-Dissolve-In-Just-An-Hour couldn't care less where those stray strands end up. You ever try prying that stuff off your windshield ahead of rush hour? It's a nightmare! And only just a sample of his wake . . . Or *it's* wake. We never did determine the species. Just that whoever's behind that glittery getup is a Class F Careless Crook.

I often wonder why Spider-Man chooses not to murder his enemies like The Punisher does, opting instead for ""mercy,"" which, of course, means burdening their already suffering families with millions in medical bills. Even moreso than Daredevil. Not advocating death here, just examining a popular psychosis. In fact, INN has their Spider-Sheep advocating comas and iron lungs as baseline for deserved punishment. True for some of these goons, sure. Not for the vast majority of human life Spider-Man hospitalizes though. Deescalation tactics? Non-existent to The Judge in Red Tights, who slacks no opportunity to deal his favorite high-flying, highfalutin double damage kick. He breathes violence! It satiates his bloodlust, and so long as he preys on whomever the Spider-Squad media deems worthy of irreversible harm, the Masked Menace will continue his spine-shattering terror.

People need to understand this.

To recognize that by parading the deluded valor of a walking weapon, they are actually enabling chaos incarnate. The destruction of order. Suffice it to say, for our own survival, we ought to stop digesting Spider-Man's mythos so hungrily. Romanticised crime is still/will always be utter lawlessness, unpredictable, and if we fail to vomit up this creature scuttling down our throats, it will begin to poison from within. Our awareness and our rejection of Spider-Man's insurgent mayhem are perhaps the only weapons we powerless, grounded folk have to overcome the vanity fueling this behavior. We must take action as one. New York City can no longer afford self-indulgent, unaccountably dangerous ""heroes"" at the cost of having to then endure their inevitable supervillains, who spawn year after year with even less consideration for human life. It's a circular madness! No more, I say.

Badges above masks.

Cuffs before webs.

Gavels. Process. Rehabilitation.

Said systems were dully elected for our own safety. To abide Spider-Man's return is to abandon their purpose, and on the impending day his bloodlust finally evolves its lethality in the direction of our homes and children, it is upon those systems we must rely. Upon New York's finest, who still decide to brave each and every alien invasion despite their lack of protective shields and super repulsors. When catastrophe wraps fear tighter than a flaming bow on your neck, it is not cartoons zipping overhead who restore a sense of normality but instead the human faces and trusted uniforms standing next to you, who take the time the chart your thoughts. Who offer their first names as they wheel your sons into ambulances and talk you through the next 48 hours. These are the real heroes, and their names do not derive from bugs or birds or mythic Gods on high. We share their names, as we strive to share their courage. Lee. DeWolff. Stacy. With a collective diligence, we may yet cement officers like these into the burrows of New York's permanent memory banks. Don't they, of all people, deserve this honor over those with nothing to lose and everything to hide? The alternative we face is to take a comfy seat inside Insomniac's runaway wonder train and simply pray the Spider-Man feels up to the chore of saving us from a peril we ourselves designed.

Trust New York.

Not spandex.

. . .

WE'LL BUY PHOTOS!

Shortly after Spider-Man went underground, thanks in part to my end of the press, I discovered a troubling secret about our photographer employed for the Web-head's portraits. Parker, you've seen the name. Apparently, the man didn't have the first clue how to get a straight shot of any other super freak beside The Bug. So I fired him. Then he went west coast. Started working for INN, if you could believe it. That traitor.

But that's beside the point.

With The Bug back and Parker out, The Bugle's in need of some new freelance. People we can train. Got to have talent, heart, a good eye. None of that green screen internet malarkey. We don't do the YouTubes here. We do news. Photos. That's what we'll pay you for, and only if it comes cheap. We'll talk real pay after you prove yourself.

Send in the best three shots you can take, and maybe I'll buy one of em. $25. I choose which picture. Oh, and it won't be cash. I'm told those Playing Station gift card codes are more valuable than gold these days for you kids. Personally, if I was a younger Jameson, I'd just go spend that amount on a bar somewhere here in The City That Never Sleeps. But taxes work a little different with gift cards and contests, so we'll go with that.

There's room for three new freelancers. I'll buy the best photo from each. 

Got it?

Here's what I'm looking for.

In your first photo attempt, focus on exposing that wall-crawling, web-slinging, white-eyed acrobat's flagrant disrespect for physicists everywhere. Snap Spider-Man diving off a high-rise balcony (illegally) or clinging to a nationally treasured monument (also illegal). Try not to rely too heavily on his ballerina body alone. The shot needs context, too. Pay special attention to whatever he's soaring above, passed, or onto. Foreground and background, both equally important here to keep things interesting. And remember, he's got to be acting, I don't know, Spider-ee.

For your next entree, I want to remind New York City of Spider-Man's relentless brutality. His is over-the-top, comic book violent antics hold zero value in our society, and if you can fit enough of his fists, kicks, and webs in one shot with a heap of hapless goons, costumed or otherwise, well, that would make for one helluva front page.

Last item on my list is simple - Wild card. Whatever you want, with or without Spider-Man. Could be landscapes, could be close-ups. Flagpoles. Bridges. Squirrels. Garden parties. Squirrels having garden parties. Spider-Man destroying a squirrel family garden party. Now, there's your pulitzar! Just ensure whatever you produce for this category entertains an especially tuned mastery of the craft. Lighting, composition, drama. Might help to make me laugh with this one. I like horror, too, though. Tones are great for creativity as a whole, I say.

A few rules.

1. I want pictures of Spider-Man! Not just Guy-Who-Dresses-In-Black-Leather-40's-Goggles. So the Web-head's got new suits? Good for him. Doesn't change reader expectations. They want an icon, not a color wheel, so if you want to get paid, catch him in his Classic Suit. Or maybe the one with the white spider. I suppose I'll allow those Hollywood replicas he flaunts occasionally, as well. Just get me something red and blue, alright? Something normal. Well, normal for a gravity defying bug person, that is.

2. Forget the stickers. Dump the frames. In-camera color correction's fine, but I've no use for words and shapes and tacky photo borders. I run a newspaper, not The Girl Scouts of America. Professionalism. You millennials oughta ask your parents about it sometime.

3. Save the plagiarism for your math homework. Nothing grinds my teeth harder than journalistic dishonesty. You put up someone else's talent, and I'll know. Trust me. My secretary cross references imaging databases in her sleep. Whatever those are.

4. Once you submit your three photos, you're done. No do-overs. I need a confident portfolio, not backtracking wishwash. And don't even think about uploading just one or two, either. I learned my lesson with Parker. One-trick Photographers do me no good. Prove you can diversify your work per my requests, and then we'll talk a future here at The Bugle.

5. High quality, top-tier resolution only. As little compression as you can manage. So help me God if I get another Dutch angle flip-phone photo of a photo on a television, I will lose it, DOGGONIT!

6. Submissions from accounts younger than this here job posting are obviously duplicates with the same creators. Anyone pulling bogus crap like this'll be persecuted to the fullest extent of my editors.

7. Attention all Insomniac News Network employees, pack up and go home. Your shots are no more welcome here than you are at my office any day of the year outside of Christmas.

8. Brant here. Secretary. Hi.  J.J. wanted me explain this part because he, well, computer stuff disagrees with him. Your words, J.J. Not mine.

Anyway, to officialize your submissions, just upload the three photos once asked down the line. We'll want them separately, rather than together, as in, a photo submission from you one day, another a few days later, the last a few days after that. See, J.J. plans to make three Submission Collection Posts in early October. A post per category. Makes sense, right? You just have to upload one corresponding photo with a caption to the comment section of each post, and we'll review your work thoroughly each time. The photos need to be commented onto each post by the time of the next posting, and eventually by the final hard submission deadline.

Here's the submission schedule. EST.

October 10th at 12:00 AM - Spider Antics Photo Post

October 13th at 12:00 AM - Excessive Combat Photo Post

October 16th at 12:00 AM - Personal Talent Show-off Photo Post

October 19th at 11:59 PM - (Previous post photos due)

Uploading images to a Reddit comment is pretty straightforward. Potential employees are expected to figure that out. We recommend the highest resolution you can attach, but we also understand the difficulty of shooting in 4K, so tiny details in that particular format will unfortunately not be considered against other 1080p photos. Just to keep things fair.

In case you're wondering why we don't just want direct inbox submissions, it's because J. J. prefers publicly viewable entrees. Competition inspiring quality, and all. Also, his posts, like this one, will be on multiple subreddit communities. Our team at the Bugle discourages uploading the same entree photo to multiple, identical submission posts, as it seems desperate. Furthermore, redditors harassing each other in the comments will not be eligible for the winnings. Neither will anyone outside of the US and Canada, though they are welcomed to compete for fun.

The winners to have their photos bought and featured on The Daily Bugle will be announced October 22nd on each participating subreddit and will be inboxed on how to receive their rewards that day. A long list of runner-ups will be ranked as well, although we currently lack the budget necessary to fund more prizes. However, if you are passionate enough about our cause and wish to donate toward more awards for more freelancers, please inbox J.J. on this account. He will personally discuss with you how you can help us. The Daily Bugle would appreciate any amount you could offer our potential photographers.

Feel free to ask any clarification questions in the comment section to this post. Either J.J. or I will get to them as soon as we can. Or, if you like, you can just discuss ideas on what you might shoot.

This is Betty Brant signing off.

Well, folks, that's about it. She covered everything. Everything which is, of course, subject to change, to improve, unlike Spider-Man. Anyway, what're you waiting for? Chinese New Year?

Get to it.

. . .

TL;DR - Learn to read, you coconut.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright, Reddit.com,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J. Jonah Jameson here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lock the cellar. Batten the hatches. Buy your wife a bugspray and listen up because I&amp;#39;ve got news, people. The sort you oughta know. That web-faced, wall-crawling freakshow&amp;#39;s on the rise again. According to trusted sources, New York City&amp;#39;s scuttling scourge, peacock vigilante, Spider-Man, no doubt plans resumption to his brand of Manhattan &amp;quot;heroics&amp;quot; as early as week&amp;#39;s end! This, following a yearslong hiatus, during which the lot of us optimistic folk thought that Web-head flat out Web-dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When footage first broke two years back, I bet it phoney-baloney Photoshop nonsense. Computer made; just to stir up trouble, views, pointless debate. That&amp;#39;s all I&amp;#39;d grant those pansy pandering falsofiers over at Insomniac Nightly News. After all, their last viral scoop was what? A space cat with a talking backpack? Give me a break. Looney McLoser hadn&amp;#39;t spun so much as a Central Park hammock in all the years since Captain Beenox and Dr. Activision justly beat the sucker silly. Now, suddenly, he&amp;#39;s been posing pretty for exactly one network and the shots are cleaner than Parker&amp;#39;s best day at The Bugle? Impossible!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except, disappointing as it was, the video department at ESU did confirm authenticity - everything but the supposed &amp;quot;happenchance&amp;quot; context of the footage. My theory? INN struck a deal. They must have promised that bug braggart toady batches of weekly scarlet boot-licking airtime in exchange for becoming the central hub of this nation&amp;#39;s next meteoric rise in ad-revenue rich idiocracy! It&amp;#39;s exactly what they needed. A bizzaro underdog anthem to cheat up their theatrics, match their mania, and bulldoze every other story on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the record: We at The Daily Bugle would never knowingly conduct business with super-beings for profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let&amp;#39;s stay on topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That splashy spandex moron is about to mount yet another scheme to plunge this city into an Arachnophobic Armageddon. Just yesterday, exiting an Uber-cab, I even saw the beginnings of it myself, hanging there. Sticky. Tangled. Obnoxiously silver. The one method of vandalism, both private and public, that neither sector has ever managed to prevent. Yet Mr. They-Dissolve-In-Just-An-Hour couldn&amp;#39;t care less where those stray strands end up. You ever try prying that stuff off your windshield ahead of rush hour? It&amp;#39;s a nightmare! And only just a sample of his wake . . . Or &lt;em&gt;it&amp;#39;s&lt;/em&gt; wake. We never did determine the species. Just that whoever&amp;#39;s behind that glittery getup is a Class F Careless Crook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often wonder why Spider-Man chooses not to murder his enemies like The Punisher does, opting instead for &amp;quot;mercy,&amp;quot; which, of course, means burdening their already suffering families with millions in medical bills. Even moreso than Daredevil. Not advocating death here, just examining a popular psychosis. In fact, INN has their Spider-Sheep advocating comas and iron lungs as baseline for deserved punishment. True for some of these goons, sure. Not for the vast majority of human life Spider-Man hospitalizes though. Deescalation tactics? Non-existent to The Judge in Red Tights, who slacks no opportunity to deal his favorite high-flying, highfalutin double damage kick. He breathes violence! It satiates his bloodlust, and so long as he preys on whomever the Spider-Squad media deems worthy of irreversible harm, the Masked Menace will continue his spine-shattering terror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People need to understand this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To recognize that by parading the deluded valor of a walking weapon, they are actually enabling chaos incarnate. The destruction of order. Suffice it to say, for our own survival, we ought to stop digesting Spider-Man&amp;#39;s mythos so hungrily. Romanticised crime is still/will always be utter lawlessness, unpredictable, and if we fail to vomit up this creature scuttling down our throats, it will begin to poison from within. Our awareness and our rejection of Spider-Man&amp;#39;s insurgent mayhem are perhaps the only weapons we powerless, grounded folk have to overcome the vanity fueling this behavior. We must take action as one. New York City can no longer afford self-indulgent, unaccountably dangerous &amp;quot;heroes&amp;quot; at the cost of having to then endure their inevitable supervillains, who spawn year after year with even less consideration for human life. It&amp;#39;s a circular madness! No more, I say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Badges above masks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cuffs before webs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gavels. Process. Rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Said systems were dully elected for our own safety. To abide Spider-Man&amp;#39;s return is to abandon their purpose, and on the impending day his bloodlust finally evolves its lethality in the direction of our homes and children, it is upon those systems we must rely. Upon New York&amp;#39;s finest, who still decide to brave each and every alien invasion despite their lack of protective shields and super repulsors. When catastrophe wraps fear tighter than a flaming bow on your neck, it is not cartoons zipping overhead who restore a sense of normality but instead the human faces and trusted uniforms standing next to you, who take the time the chart your thoughts. Who offer their first names as they wheel your sons into ambulances and talk you through the next 48 hours. These are the real heroes, and their names do not derive from bugs or birds or mythic Gods on high. We share their names, as we strive to share their courage. Lee. DeWolff. Stacy. With a collective diligence, we may yet cement officers like these into the burrows of New York&amp;#39;s permanent memory banks. Don&amp;#39;t they, of all people, deserve this honor over those with nothing to lose and everything to hide? The alternative we face is to take a comfy seat inside Insomniac&amp;#39;s runaway wonder train and simply pray the Spider-Man feels up to the chore of saving us from a peril we ourselves designed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not spandex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WE&amp;#39;LL BUY PHOTOS!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after Spider-Man went underground, thanks in part to my end of the press, I discovered a troubling secret about our photographer employed for the Web-head&amp;#39;s portraits. Parker, you&amp;#39;ve seen the name. Apparently, the man didn&amp;#39;t have the first clue how to get a straight shot of any other super freak beside The Bug. So I fired him. Then he went west coast. Started working for INN, if you could believe it. That traitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s beside the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With The Bug back and Parker out, The Bugle&amp;#39;s in need of some new freelance. People we can train. Got to have talent, heart, a good eye. None of that green screen internet malarkey. We don&amp;#39;t do the YouTubes here. We do news. Photos. That&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ll pay you for, and only if it comes cheap. We&amp;#39;ll talk real pay after you prove yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Send in the best three shots you can take, and maybe I&amp;#39;ll buy one of em. $25. I choose which picture. Oh, and it won&amp;#39;t be cash. I&amp;#39;m told those Playing Station gift card codes are more valuable than gold these days for you kids. Personally, if I was a younger Jameson, I&amp;#39;d just go spend that amount on a bar somewhere here in The City That Never Sleeps. But taxes work a little different with gift cards and contests, so we&amp;#39;ll go with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s room for three new freelancers. I&amp;#39;ll buy the best photo from each. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your first photo attempt, focus on exposing that wall-crawling, web-slinging, white-eyed acrobat&amp;#39;s flagrant disrespect for physicists everywhere. Snap Spider-Man diving off a high-rise balcony (illegally) or clinging to a nationally treasured monument (also illegal). Try not to rely too heavily on his ballerina body alone. The shot needs context, too. Pay special attention to whatever he&amp;#39;s soaring above, passed, or onto. Foreground and background, both equally important here to keep things interesting. And remember, he&amp;#39;s got to be acting, I don&amp;#39;t know, Spider-ee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your next entree, I want to remind New York City of Spider-Man&amp;#39;s relentless brutality. His is over-the-top, comic book violent antics hold zero value in our society, and if you can fit enough of his fists, kicks, and webs in one shot with a heap of hapless goons, costumed or otherwise, well, that would make for one helluva front page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last item on my list is simple - Wild card. Whatever you want, with or without Spider-Man. Could be landscapes, could be close-ups. Flagpoles. Bridges. Squirrels. Garden parties. Squirrels having garden parties. Spider-Man destroying a squirrel family garden party. Now, there&amp;#39;s your pulitzar! Just ensure whatever you produce for this category entertains an especially tuned mastery of the craft. Lighting, composition, drama. Might help to make me laugh with this one. I like horror, too, though. Tones are great for creativity as a whole, I say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want pictures of Spider-Man! Not just Guy-Who-Dresses-In-Black-Leather-40&amp;#39;s-Goggles. So the Web-head&amp;#39;s got new suits? Good for him. Doesn&amp;#39;t change reader expectations. They want an icon, not a color wheel, so if you want to get paid, catch him in his Classic Suit. Or maybe the one with the white spider. I suppose I&amp;#39;ll allow those Hollywood replicas he flaunts occasionally, as well. Just get me something red and blue, alright? Something normal. Well, normal for a gravity defying bug person, that is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forget the stickers. Dump the frames. In-camera color correction&amp;#39;s fine, but I&amp;#39;ve no use for words and shapes and tacky photo borders. I run a newspaper, not The Girl Scouts of America. Professionalism. You millennials oughta ask your parents about it sometime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Save the plagiarism for your math homework. Nothing grinds my teeth harder than journalistic dishonesty. You put up someone else&amp;#39;s talent, and I&amp;#39;ll know. Trust me. My secretary cross references imaging databases in her sleep. Whatever those are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you submit your three photos, you&amp;#39;re done. No do-overs. I need a confident portfolio, not backtracking wishwash. And don&amp;#39;t even think about uploading just one or two, either. I learned my lesson with Parker. One-trick Photographers do me no good. Prove you can diversify your work per my requests, and then we&amp;#39;ll talk a future here at The Bugle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;High quality, top-tier resolution only. As little compression as you can manage. So help me God if I get another Dutch angle flip-phone photo of a photo on a television, I will lose it, DOGGONIT!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Submissions from accounts younger than this here job posting are obviously duplicates with the same creators. Anyone pulling bogus crap like this&amp;#39;ll be persecuted to the fullest extent of my editors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, to officialize your submissions, just upload the three photos once asked down the line.

&lt;p&gt;Uploading images to a Reddit comment is pretty straightforward. Potential employees are expected to figure that out.

Only have it as a load out when the other team uses it.One of the best things about this game that they got right that no other game does is that when a player gets shot they can't melee. In all competitive shooters you can be shooting someone point blank and they can still stab you. Think cod and battlefield and other games like that. But in TLOU, if a player gets shot it causes a stutter that prevents a melee hit. In that last clip (for those who don't play the game) the enemy was running at him with a built up one hit melee attack. If he didn't make all those revolver shots he would have been hit, died, and lost. But since he landed all of his shots he prevented the one hit melee and one the game, hence the gross amount of bags of tea. "

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",0.0,,False,12.0,False,5.0,17 year old looking for advice from video game developers/journalists,False,"I’m gonna be real with ya, chief. I looked into video game design critically at one point and it kind of sounds like a gamble to me. It’s one of those things you need experience for, and even then you aren’t guaranteed a spot, you know? I read about a lot of people who were hired for a project, poured their heart and soul into it, and were fired once it was finished. Only to struggle to find another job for months. So I, personally, would lean towards journalism. But I’m also a pessimist. So follow your dreams or whatever. Lmao. I'm a game dev. I've been working in the industry for just over 10 years.

My advice, pick something else. 

From what I've heard, game journalists don't make very much, but their jobs are really cool. I know some journalists who get to travel all over the world for their job. They can travel so much though, its actually an annoyance sometimes. As for game devs, well first, its just very competitive. You have to be good at what you do to be able to get work in this industry. As for work hours, sometimes they can be pretty long, especially during crunch, although the industry is getting better at not turning people into slaves. Thosse things considered, the big issue for me with the game industry is just stability. Games are not a stable business. I've been a part of 2 studio-wide layoffs in the past year. This is not really the norm for me, in fact, before this year, I'd never been laid off. But I bring it up to show you that it can, and does happen--and its unfortunately pretty common. Another unfortunate thing to consider is that many game jobs are only available in places with high cost of living. As you get more experienced though, studios become more ok with remote work. And in recent years I've actually seen a big push to staff remotely, because it lowers business costs.

As for tips, if you really do want to get into it. My advice, figure out exactly what you want to do in the industry first and then attack it from that angle.  In my experience, the school you choose when getting into games really doesn't make a big difference. Its all about how you apply yourself while you're there. And I know a lot of people in the industry who are completely self taught. The most successful people I've met, worked in the industry while they were actually in college. This means interning or taking very low paying gigs just to grow your experience. This also helps you to get your name out there, and knowing people from within the industry is very helpful for landing jobs. People like to work with people that they are familiar with and know do good work."

I started playing fortnite &amp; now when I’m not playing I head the sound effects and see the visuals of the game. Is this normal ? Does anybody else have this ?,False,"It sounds like im joking but im not, thats called the Tetris Effect. Becoming so use to a certain activity that you start to see it in everyday activities. It is extemely common especially with gamers. Happens to me alot.Yes, I see and play games in my head until I get the chance to play them in person. (I still get my work done, just an active daydreamer)It's pretty normal if you're playing a lot. It's how they get yaThat’s really interesting. I’ve had similar experiences as well. After playing Watch Dogs for a bit, while in the car I thought to hack a traffic light. 
There was a period while I was playing Zelda Breath of Wild that I thought about how much everything around me would be worth since I sold almost everything in my inventory in that game. In my experience, absolutely.During the height of the GTA III craze, I remember driving to work, and when I would see see a cop on the street, I would drive extra carefully so I wouldn’t get a “star”. It happens to me all the time. I once was in a stage where I was spending hours a day on a jigsaw puzzle. It got to the point I was seeing jigsaw pieces every time I closed my eyes. That's when I decided I needed a break. This has happened to me before, especially after playing Metal Gear Solid 5. Every time I saw a cargo crate in real life my first instinct was to call it in for pick up. Funny phenomenon. You should try acid. I have a similar experience only when I play in the late evening and I am super tired, while I'm the bed trying to sleep I can still hear the sound effects and see some visuals of the game I just played. A part of all of that I have no other experiences. My theory is that the brain activity of someone who plays games regularly and someone who doesn't is different. Since you have now start acclimating your brain to the patterns and strategic thinking of a game such as Fortnite, when you're not playing your brain is kind of on a deficit. It's craving the activity so it starts creating it. Kind of like a temporary phantom limb. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just keep in mind that you have to train yourself to play games within moderation. It's really easy to go at it whole hog. It is possible to get addicted and shut yourself out of the real world and at your age you are especially susceptible.When I was in college I played a lot of modern warfare. I was always the guy who shot down UAVs. In real life I would think ""hit 🔼"" when I saw a plane in the sky. Since 🔼 was to switch to my rocket launcher to shoot down the UAVs. Back on the PS2 there was a series of games called Ratchet and Clank. In this game,  you collected little bolts as currency. You could smash environmental objects and they would have lots of bolts to collect from them. Later on in the game,  you could collect an upgrade that when you jumped in the air and hit the melee attack button would do a ground smash that shattered any and all objects in a pretty large radius around you. It was a great way to get extra money. 

So I was playing through them, one after the other in order, because I hadn't in a while,  and why not? But one night I was driving through my neighborhood and out in front of one of the houses was a ton of those solar lights.  Lining the driveway,  sidewalk,  etc. My first reaction was that I really needed to smash those,  that's gonna be some sweet money. 

Conditioning is real,  welcome to the club.This can happen when you play too much.What your describing is known as the Tetris effect. Though it usually happens when playing one game for a long period of time not just a day. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_effectIt happens if I play any game that I get immersed in for a while. It’s worse if you play a story game where you here the characters thoughts...afterward you will continue to think and hear there voice in your head while your thinking. 
I would suggest you spend sometime away from it, maybe just a day, when it gets bad. Just remember it’s only a game and if your afraid your losing touch with reality just walk away for a while. I find reading a book or doing something active helps reset my brain when I play games for too long.Totally normal.

Years ago, I discovered Fallout 3 and would be genuinely excited to find bobby pins, the same object In both worlds triggered my brain the same way.Pretty normal, no big deal. It happened to me twice with videigames and a lot more with the university's books, just take a break of a copple of daysWell I have never experienced that, and I started playing when I about 14. So, that’s weird. I sometime day dream about a game or something but it’s never just casually seeing visuals of the game.

Also play better games."

So many gems on that consoleStart with emulation. You probably already have a computer, so it requires little investment. I started by buying a cheap generic controller, then got some USB Super Nintendo controllers. Get some roms of some games before Nintendo sues everybody, see what you like from the internet's top 25 lists for things (ex: Google search ""top games for NES"" or whatever), and if you like something enough, maybe buy it and the original hardware! Most computers can probably emulate up to the ps2/GameCube era without too much issue. If you want to play games that are cheap and more modern (decent 3d modeling and such), get an Xbox 360. Everyone's getting rid of them, so the games and hardware are affordable. Those are my suggestions.Day of the tentacle! The remastered version is on phones and tablets.

Yoshi was cool and all but he never replaced Hammer, Frog, toki, raccoon, and boot Mario. Super Mario 3 brings back so much good memories and if Super Mario World had all those power ups with Yoshi it would have been hands down the greatest game of all time.Ofc it’s the best, that one was amazingThis is what i tell people is my FAVORITE game ever. Smb3 just tickles that part of my brain that makes me love video games.I’m not a Nintendo guy, I’m a Sony guyThe original cartridge was a huge feat.

So it was actually a Smartphone game. I think I played it on a android Smartphone.

The game was very simple, a zombie was standing from a far without moving and you just had to shoot it. You had a rifle and had to kill the standing still zombie, but it wasn't very easy to kill the zombie cuz there was air resistance, so the bullet had sometimes a great drop and curve. When you shot a bullet you were shown the animation of the bullet flying toward the zombie whether you misses or not, then you could take your next shot if you missed. Your main goal was just killing the one zombie which was standing Idly from a distance. You kill the zombie and that's it, game over, then you start again but distance varied from each different time, sometimes the zombie stood closer or farther. As long as I remember, I believe you were in a desert. The game was simple but very good because killing the zombie with the air resistance was quite challenging. I don't know who old the game is, but at that time, meaning the last time I played was roughly 6-7 years ago.

9aukq4,1.0,0.0,,,"I first encountered Strange Brigade during a meeting with Rebellion at E3. Although we only had a limited play session, we were impressed with the game as it was a very pleasant surprise.

The game is finally here and now the public can enjoy the winning mixture of action, puzzles, comedy, and nostalgia. Playing as one of four characters in a 1930s setting, players can play either solo or co-op as they explore and battle around Egypt against an ancient evil.

Armed with pistols, grenades, shotguns, rifles, and machine guns, players must batter endless waves of supernatural enemies who are determined to stop you no matter the cost.

Thankfully you can give out a ton of damage from punches to your arsenal, as well as special crates that allow players to purchase additional weapons for a limited time that can really help clear things out.

There are also numerous traps which can be triggered and it is very satisfying to watch a horde get cut to shreds in a blade trap or impaled and roasted with others.

Players will be able to upgrade their weapons as well as increase their ammo supply at various checkpoints along the way.

Players will also have the option to solve puzzles to get additional loot as well as access to other areas of the map.  

The characters also have a magical amulet which allows them to open various objects but also allows them to collect energy from dispatched enemies and use it against them when a sufficient amount has been collected.

The levels are very engaging and include tombs, dig sites, market places, and other locales which also have plenty to keep players engaged.

Rebellion has announced that a 5th playable character will be available at launch and there are at least three other players coming down the road.

There is a big difference in character play as I enjoy having the rapid-fire approach of a Machine Gun but some may find the single shot rifle or a thunderous shotgun more to their liking. I found the shotgun to be a devastating weapon but having to reload after two shots makes it harder when playing on your own as you can get overwhelmed fast.

The variety of enemies is good as undead walkers do make up the bulk of the enemy force but there are Mummies, Pirates, and armor clad guardians who take a bit of damage before they go down.

The game also has an interesting feature in that there is an announcer who narrates the action and chapters with witty quips that gives the game a sense of the old-style action serials of old.

Players looking to take a break from the campaign can play a Horde mode where enemies come in waves and players must use gold to purchase access to other areas and weapons. There is also a score mode where players have to race through a level causing as much mayhem as they can along the way.

Strange Brigade is a very fun game that once I started to play I could not put it down. I actually completed the game solo and now look forward to playing the campaign with a team so we can try other tactics and explore other areas.

The graphics and sound of the game are solid and it moves along at a very crisp pace which allows players to have fast action and smooth movements.

I am really looking forward to see what DLC will follow as I absolutely love this game as Strange Brigade is a winning and fun adventure that is not to be missed.

That being said lets not pretend like this Epic vs Google thing is about ""security"". This is about two things, Google not getting in on the Fortnite money, and the precedent that Epic sets if it continues down this path. 

First of all, any of us could go on the Play store and find a plethora of apps that would absolutely decimate our phones or steal our data. Many people will do it by accident every day. So for Google to claim this massive security flaw days after the Android Fortnite release is extremely convenient. It doesn't even matter if it's true because a vast majority of users couldn't know for sure either way. 

Second let's be honest, Google is being forced to protect future income in case any other major developers decide to more or less cutout the middle man. 30% is a lot of money and for some of these guys it could be millions of dollars of in app purchases. Telling a company they can save millions by cutting Google gives the developers an easy choice. 

This may become a pretty serious battle between the two companies that may have longer lasting consequences for us as consumers.

The first few minutes of the second game take place some months into the future, and Clementine is now ten. Then we cut forward sixteen months, and Clementine is about twelve. During this period, about a month and a half passes. 


In the third season, we've cut ahead a few years, and Clementine is well into her teens, about sixteen. About two months pass, and she remains sixteen throughout the season.

In the fourth and possible final season, we cut ahead several years, and Clementine is now in her early twenties and caring for a child. Unsure how much time passes, or how old she is exactly.

So I just made this as a reference point. If you have any edits you'd like me to make, just comment.

Starting Age (S1, E1,): 8
Ending Age (S4, E5,): (about) 22

Hello! My name is Nic Woolfe. I consider storytelling to be the most important tool human society has ever created. I’m also a big nerd, and love Marvel, DC, Dragonball, Power Rangers, Nintendo, etc. My main goal is to talk about how the stories we consume are crafted. This can come in a variety of different ways, from delving into the themes the story talks about and how they’re explored to considering a “what if” scenario on how little wrinkles can make you see the story in a different way. I look forward to exploring the possibilities with you all!

I just remember being this playable white character that looked like a stick figure. What you have to do is guide him with water while hes falling down the entire time. Through like this cave or something. The game is played vertically because hes falling from the top and you have to catch him and guide him with water through it. It's weird and I'm explaining it as best I can. I remember being weirdly amazed with the game at the time and idk what to type to try to find it.

We played a few different things. Rocket league, borderlands (co op), black ops zombies, switching back and forth in short, episodic games like Dead By Daylight... And telltale games. We would alternate for each decision, making for an interesting storyline. Some design games can be played together, even if only one person is manning the controller, such as Prison Architect, The Sims, and This War of Mine.

Oh, and overcooked. But that will be sure to test your relationship. ;)

Happy gaming. Video games were a great way to spend time together that brought us closer. I sure do miss her. Monster Hunter world, heroes of the storm, Lego games, Minecraft, any Nintendo game."

Titanfall 2, Mad Max, Elite Dangerous, Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Middle Earth:Shadow of Mordor, Mass Effect Series,  Assassin’s Creed 4,  Metro series, S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Call of Pripyat, Elder Scrolls (mostly Skyrim), Fallout (3 and New Vegas especially), Alien: Isolation, The Darkness 2, Doom (new one), Dragon’s Dogma, Rebel Galaxy, The Witcher series (go ahead and skip the first one though. Start with Assassins of Kings), Wolfenstein (the 2 new ones), Dawn of War series (but not so much 3) , Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine, Verdunn, Xcom: Enemy Unknown and Xcom 2, South Park:Stick of Truth, Ruiner, Tomb Raider (2013) and Rise of the Tomb Raider.

sorry for the long list but I wanted to give as broad a selection as I could, these are just some of the games I’ve played but most of them should be accessible to you in some form or another, although it would help if you were to include what system you mainly play on (PlayStation, Xbox, PC)"

The comics do it by only jumping to Matt’s perspective when he’s using his senses. The Netflix series doesn’t visualize it at all and does it all in the sound design.

I like the idea you had, about having a minimal, pulsating view of the world around him. I think for things in the distance, they’d be visible, but highly obscured.

I think this could be really cool for story telling. Imagine a boss battle. Car goes by and tot get a pulse and nothing is in the room. Then a siren blares and suddenly the room is full of enemies. Lot of atmospheric possibilities, and interesting mechanics like having to make noise, or maybe even leave an enemy up so they can make noise while you sneak around."

Borderlands has a lot of content and I could play that game for hours (in fact I have lol). Dark Souls is always fun because the challenge just really pushes me onward. Back in the day I would’ve suggest Black Flag first but my love for AC has dwindled quite a bit in the last few years but it’s probably one of the best in terms of story in the series. Dude dying light was  hands down my favorite game. So much to do. The grind is fun and it’s sooooooo satisfying killing the mobs. Highly recommend. "

I am not a fan of pay to win games, I’d rather spend the money unlocking more content like skins, maps etc.

And as much as I enjoy showing off what my character can do to a low-leveled player, I hate having to play for hours upon hours before I can get anywhere close to using my character to her/his fullest potential. 

So I’m looking for a game that is purely skill based and fun. I want experience and over all knowledge to matter, things like predicting your enemy, using your knowledge of their abilities and weaknesses against them. A game in which each player’s style of play is unique and important when it comes to defeating one another.

Preferably multiplayer but single player works too. This can be a racing game, mmo, rpg, anything really. 

These are the games I have played so don’t suggest them: 
League of Legends, Dota2, Csgo, overwatch, cod, battledfield, paladins, fortnite, gta, rainbow six, pubg, farcry and dark souls

X-360, X-One or a PS2 controller. Fun fact PS2 had pressure sensitive buttons before it was cool. 

Worst I’ve owned was the Steam Controller. I like it but Id sooner have bought a wireless mouse and keyboard. Some applications do not allow the Steam Controller to be used when they are the selected window. Forcing you to get up anyway. In addition it is not ideal for some games and can take some setup between games on their first play.
It also takes way too many steps to get it to play nice with other controllers at the same time. The biggest issue is it’s the most uncomfortable controller I’ve ever handled, it requires an altered grip to wield if you do not have large hands. Mad Katz micro PS2 controller OG Xbox DukeMind controlI'm gonna have to say GameCube. However, when I first played Four Swords, having gameplay both on my GBA and tv screen blew my fucking mind.

see my 10,000 game collection 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsXxtLK9fpgHence I didn't own any SNES games back then...RPG's like Final Fantasy 3 were $70.  Agree that I would love to find a first party controller for $14.99.  Seems like even back then they would have been $29.99.  After looking at the inflation rate from 97 (I assume this is from 97 due to the Madden ad) a $70 game would = $106 in 2017 money. I seem to remember some like Phantasy Star IV and Chrono Trigger being around that To be fair, SF alpha 2 is still considered one of the best fighting games in history.

These exploitive mechanisms have no place in games being marketed to minors, and perhaps no place in games at all,&amp;quot; Lee said Tuesday in a press statement.

&gt; Electronic Arts announced on Nov. 16, a day before the game&amp;#039;s official launch day, it is temporarily turning off all in-game purchases in &amp;quot;Star Wars Battlefront II&amp;quot; in response to the negative sentiment from the gaming community.

&gt; The gaming community flooded social media and Reddit with thousands of negative posts, saying the company is unfairly compelling consumers to spend more money for content that should be part of the initial $60 game price.

I prefer playing closer on a small monitor, it’s hard for me to play certain types of games on the couch sitting further away. Simple, organized, and awesome!Buy a pc or ps4. Either is good.

I honestly prefer last gen CoD over the newer games. Black Ops was great, I absolutely agree. I’ll always have a soft spot for those and the MW trilogy. Especially MW2, that was the first CoD I prestige’d in. I wish the developers actually cared about the games and got rid of the hackers. I’ve been wanting to replay them!I was in a competitive clan in Modern Warfare when Black Ops came out.  The spawn locations on maps were so atrocious that you could literally position your team *juuuuuust* right on damn near any map and force the entire enemy team to use a single spawn.

You could then overlap fire on that spot and spawn kill the entire enemy team over and over again till you won.  By the time you ran out of ammo, the team would have earned enough killstreaks to keep it going.

The game was so bad that we never played it competitively and the clan broke up a couple months after launch.


Edit: Zombies on Black Ops was 1,000 though.

MW2 was pretty much where I peaked skillwise. Loved the first Black Ops but was pretty bad at it. Hated all the others online. Infinite Warfare was pretty much the final nail in the coffin for me. Liked the idea but hated the game. I haven't given WW2 much time, apparently it is decent though. Any thoughts?My last one was B02. It had a pretty good multiplayer I thought."

Basically, inflation of the US dollar has raised the costs of living while other things have lagged behind or have not been raised at a proportional rate (like wages). When the seventh generation of consoles were released in 2005-2006, the average price of games were bumped up from $50 to $60 and that was over ten years ago. According to ExtraCredits, AAA titles of today need about $75-80 per unit to be worth the costs of development, but folks are hesitant to drop that much money into one thing - thus, microtransacrions and DLC style expansions (using that word loosely here) on top of a $60 price tag to make a profit.But they were actually finished games with tons of content , in 2018 not a single game is finished let alone polished or playable, or full of content "

7ijh3w,14.0,0.0,,,"Hello. After digging through a lot of interviews from the past 3 or so years that happen to come to mind, I realized there is a lot of supporting evidence stating that FromSoftware's TGA trailer is a trailer for a reboot of the Tenchu series. I will present all the evidence I can in this post.    

### The Trailer    
[Within the trailer itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWFgvbf_Zu8), we see a few different things that hint at the setting of this new title.     

-First off in the audio itself, we hear a small tune that sounds like it could come from a flute (or potentially some Asian instrument I don't know), the tune of which can often be heard in a large amount of Asian style media, particularly Japanese media, especially when that media is representing historical content.    
-In the background, we see what seems to be characters commonly associated with Asian languages. One has been identified thus far as kanji for ""Tiger"". The rest have not been identified to my knowledge.    
-The device on screen seems to be a winch, tightening for some unknown reason. while the bloody rope and the bone itself are very reminiscent of the Bloodborne style, when the winch turns, we see a metal piece inside of the rope. Upon brightening the background, [dualshockers were able to make an outline on this image](https://cdn3.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/TenchuKunai.png). This looks very clearly like a kunai. What it is on a bloody rope on a winch, is unclear.    
-""Shadows Die Twice"" can easily be seen as a reference to the Tenchu series. Two instances in which this apply is how often Ninjas are referred to as Shadows. In Tenchu 3, Rikimaru has a cutscene where he specifically refers to himself as a Shadow. The tag line itself, however, may refer instead to the final boss of Tenchu: Shadow Assassins, Onikage. Onikage is a boss who is defeated, resurrected, and beaten again within the game. Onikage can translate to ""Shadow Demon"".    

With this evidence, we can discern that the game in this trailer most likely has an eastern setting of some kind, and can potentially refer to ninjas as shadows.     

###  Previous Interviews    
In the past years, Miyazaki has expressed interest in revisiting old games, as well as moving away from the souls series in general.    

-In 2014 in an interview with Famitsu, [Miyazaki states his interest in old IPs](https://www.kotaku.com.au/2014/07/dark-souls-director-wants-to-make-a-warm-fuzzy-game/)
&gt;""We have dark fantasies like Dark Souls, of course, but I'd also like for us to make more mech games like Armored Core, or Asian style titles like **Tenchu** or Otogi: Myth of Demons. From Software used have a lot more rather quirky titles. I used to love such games or making such games, and I think there was a lot of stimulation and ideas that came from that.""    

-In a 2016 [interview with 4gamer.net](http://www.4gamer.net/games/305/G030528/20160526060/), later having specific [translations posted on NeoGAF](http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=206545809&amp;postcount=1), as well as in an [interview with IGN](http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/21/from-software-working-on-3-games-one-of-which-is-armored-core) later that year, Miyazaki expressed that multiple games were in production. In the 4gamer.net translation, we discovered the following.
&gt;For first project, it seemed like action RPG with dark fantasy setting but approached from different angle than Dark Souls    

&gt;For second project, it could be a reboot but also a new game with ideas that came from their previous franchises. 
     
&gt;For third project, he says it's something different from what the company has been doing previously. He says it will be a bit weird.  

-Miyazaki did confirm that Armored core was in production as well in that interview. In the IGN Interview, we have the following quotes.    
&gt;""So there are several titles that we are currently working on [...] Some of those are dark fantasy, some of those could be a mech [game] - that's one thing. The second thing is that one of the new titles I've been working on will probably comply with the expectations from the fans in straightforward manner. The last thing is that another title will probably be a little bit weird. When we actually announce the title, probably fans will react with 'oh, what the hell is this very weird game that Miyazaki has created?'""   
 
&gt;As for what that 'weird' game could be, Miyazaki offered only this: ""So when I say weird, I mean that the genre we're trying to try might be a little bit weird. Not only that, but all the other actual game content might be a little bit weird, yes.""    

From this we can gather that most likely more than 3 games are in production. In this, it seems like 4 games are represented: A weird one, a mech one, a dark fantasy one, and one that complies with expectations. As of this current moment, we know of 3 games in production at FromSoft. These are Armored Core, a VR game, and ""Shadows Die Twice"". This leaves a 4th game potentially in production that is unknown, and also adds to the 4gamer interview. The ""First Project"" could be ""Shadows Die Twice"", while the ""Second Project"" could be both ""Shadows Die Twice"" and Armored Core. The ""Third Project"" however is most likely the VR game as it is in a genre they have not done before, and if we are all being honest, nothing about the ""Shadows Die Twice"" trailer made us think it was any more weird than Bloodborne, so it doesn't fit with his statement in the IGN interview. 

### Other Analysis
Two other sources that I've noticed have also done an analysis as to this game being Tenchu. These are [Fextralife](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KpDQKFsvKM) and [Dualshockers](https://www.dualshockers.com/fromsoftware-new-game-tenchu-not-bloodborne-2/). I'm sure there is more, but these two have important points that I figured should be brought up.

-Both mention that the Sony brand was nowhere to be seen on this. In a world where Sony openly admits that the Switch is a competitor, not pushing their brand even harder through a near legendary developer would not only be a confusing move for Sony, but a poor one.    
-Fextralife mentions specifically that at no time recently has Bandai Namco or FromSoftware filed a trademark for a new IP of any kind. This makes this game potentially fit in with the ""Second Project"" from the 4gamer interview, as it could be an old IP (Tenchu) being brought back with ideas from the soulsborne series (specifically Bloodborne).     
-Dualshockers recognized that the characters in the background heavily resemble a more cursive form of Kanji, which you can see an example of [here](https://cdn3.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/SakamotoRyoma-letter.jpg)    
-Fextralife seems to notice that the winch itself may be of 17th-19th century origin, of which the Tenchu games take place in the 16th century. While this could potentially be a time skip, it could also be creative liberty on the devs part.     

So with all of this, there are obviously still holes in everything. Obviously a 30 second trailer isn't a whole lot to go by to give us enough definitive proof that my theory is correct, but boy oh boy does the evidence seem to create a Tower (maybe one with a shadow). 

Either way, a new FromSoft game is always welcome, especially to keep this streak of great games (that aren't published by EA or Activision) going. 

What are your thoughts? Do you think the new game is a Tenchu reboot? Or something else.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello.

You had to kill a few ankhegs, collect their heavy as hell corpses, drag them to the smith, pay a fee, and then wait a few days in-game to get it. It was cool and green, and could carry a character through the rest of the game. It had the same protection as full plate armor, but it was lighter so lower strength characters could use it without too much trouble. Was really good for Viconia.

Every game sold on Steam is owned by someone, and they get money when a copy is sold.ima is right here. the sale of rights for dead company gsmes can get very complex. sierra was bought by a company called cuc. they merged with a company called hfs to become cendant. cendant went bankrupt. then somewhere along the buy they split up their licenses with most going to Activision blizzard

another example is monkey island where Disney owns the rights to some of the games like curse of monkey island which is why they don't go anywhere

of a side point what makes me sad is I was reading up on where a lot of the ex gsme company people are and most of the Sierra people, even ones not of retirement age, don't even work in gaming anymore - too bad"

Rime - cool world and interesting puzzle solving without combat to deal with

Minecraft - a first person game without getting slaughtered in an instant by AI or 12 year old punks.

Abzu - a beautiful 3d world to explore. No man's sky might be another option. 

Start with a game or two like this just to get used to being in a game world. Other options are racing games, which are often popular with non gamers because it's an instantly relatable concept in driving. 

Other recommendation would be to start on an older console if you don't have a half way decent PC. Don't spend a lot on a ps4 or Xbone, when you can get a 360 and a ton of games for half the price. Start cheap since it's a new hobby. mario is a no brainerHey man

35 here and trying to teach my little girl on how to do it.

What are you playing at? Console or PC?

I would recommemd a 2D platfotmer so you can figure out how to coordinately press the buttons and the basic mechanics of using the analogic directional

After you're used to it you can move to 3D worlds which you will have to manage the char movement and then adjusting the camera 

After that you can figure out pretty much everything.
Let me know the platform and what kind of fun you're looking into

Cheers chapHarvest Moon, Rune factory, Animal Crossing, any of the Lego Games... Unless you like a lot of violence and team stuff then I suggest Gears of War, Resistance, Halo, Rainbow Six (any), Elder Scrolls (my step dad loved it and he didn't play a lot of video games), Diablo,  FFXIV, Dragon Age, anything really. Pick something up that looks fun and run with it. Google things if you need to and find some people to play with. Go with portal, puzzle game with fps mechanics.You like legos? Start with minecraft creative mode. Nice to learn how to control movement and vision.Maybe try minecraft or even i think RIFT is like WoW but free.
Hearthstone is free and availible on mobile as well as PC.
Animal Crossing would also be a good one for a new gamer. 
Portal 2 also is quite easy to get into.I recommend the uncharted games. They have great cinematic stories and most of them have a lot of accessibility options like aim assist and simplified controls If you are looking for a game you can play at your own pace, has great opportunities for exploration, and some good lore behind it. I would recommend Dark Souls"

&gt; Nintendo has already revealed plans to bring back the NES Classic and SNES Classic systems in 2018, giving eager players the chance to snag one of the consoles after they quickly disappeared from shelves the first time around, but it looks like a third system could be joining them: The Nintendo 64 Classic.

Derp, first paragraph. It'll be interesting to see how they'll do it, since N64 emulation has always been notoriously difficult to get right.They probably did that so no one else can take the name and in the furure they might make one. Please god let this be true Great...

What a pointless trend. Why re\-releasing all those old consoles? The quality of those are usually very average at best and could do with more games.

Also... You can have all this but better on the PC. As I am seeing it, this stuff just gets bought by idiots who sell it for 5x the price on Ebay because Nintendo never produces enough units.

Lol it was my fathers game, played a bit but didnt finish it, just sticked to Super Mario 64 Not much into horror games and maybe I was just too young, but ""F.E.A.R"" scared me several times back then. Especially when I was alone and playing in the dark. Things popping from nowhere and jumping in your face... Arggg.I remember 'Alone in the dark' was really scary for me back thenIts not quite out yet, but the trailer to 'Agony' is just... well, watch the trailer, if you havent. 

Other than that, the remake of doom was pretty horrifying. Industrial sounds mixed with crying babies was enough to require time outs.Valiant Hearts: The Great War, wasn't scary I just felt very sad and upset after.
Probably the scariest game I've ever played is P.T. but there's another game called Emily Wants To Play I couldn't play because I felt so stressed playing itSo many but an older one is 'Fatal Frame 2', great spooky atmosphere &amp; something that happens when you leave the character idle for too long/not hitting pause. 👀😳Beyond: Two Souls. The fact that Aiden was her stillborn brother really disturbed me. Not what I expected and emotionally upsetting. 

For a scary game, I'd have to go with Siren. Their faces were horrifying! Honestly Oxenfree left me feeling really strange for a couple weeks after I finished it Eternal Darkness for sure. It is a super creepy game. Resident Evil 7, crazy scary game. Resident Evil 4 also...Doki Doki literature clubDDLC is the first time in a while I’ve been that intensely horrified by a game, but the original Outlast definitely reminded me of why I loved horror in the first place.  That one was too scary for me to play lolF.E.A.R 3 scared the crap out of me, but maybe it was because I was still young. Things kept on popping up out of nowhere and the screams were very creepy... I probably shouldn't have played that game alone at midnight.Soma for emotionally disturbed. Evil Within had some scary moments.System Shock 2 scared the life out of me a few times.

It's a scary situation to lose someone or leave them but if they won't allow you this small enjoyment and controls all your free time then it will only get worse, and she'll start controlling other areas of your life too. I'm in my 30's and if my SO didn't let me play video games when I had free time from work and the kids there's no way I'd put up with it, it's a great release and a lot of fun, and there's great games coming out all the time. Hope this helps.Girlfriend not wife, you have to set an expectation that you need some down time and you're never too old to increase your cognitive skills and dexterity and doing something that you enjoy.

Playing for an hour is not unreasonable. Tell her it's something that you enjoy and take it from there . Everyone needs their me time to recharge the batteries.I used to wait for my gf (now wife) to go to sleep. I would speed it along with some sort of massage (foot or back). Set expectations. I have an agreement with my wife I will be gaming two nights a week- tuesday night, and one weekend night. On those nights, after the kids go to bed, you'll find me in Pochinki.

Honestly though it's easy to get frustrated at someone that is addicted to video gaming, because the friend or girlfriend feels less important than the games. It's up to you to communicate how important she is to you, not just verbally, but with your actions. Dedicate a few days a week to doing whatever she wants to do, BEFORE you play video games. If that doesn't sound cool, that means you probably shouldn't be with her- because (unpopular opinion time) you should care about her more than games.Tell her she's ""all up in your grill"" and I, some random guy over the internet, said you can do whatever you want. Alternatively you could tell her I bully you because you don't play games...nerd."

7e6gy8,6.0,0.0,,,"What has happened to video games? Back in my day, gaming was personal and dynamic - both in story and multiplayer. What started as a small Facebook post about a frustrating menu system has turned into a little writing exercise, and maybe you'll stick around to hear what I have to say. Man, back in my day...

Split screen has all but completely disappeared, and that's a major disappointment. Sure, the pixels were big and the enemies pretty simple, but emotions run far higher when the guy who nailed you in the face with a shotgun or rocket-launcher is sitting right next to you. Friendship and Teamwork were never stronger though. When comrades and foes both shared the same chip bag and Mountain Dew, bridges were burned and built in the same room together. Arms were punched and knuckles were bumped, and them being there made all the difference. Remember LAN parties?Have you ever have as much fun gaming as during a LAN party? People don't do that anymore, and that's unfortunate.

It also used to be that when you bought the game for $40, you got the whole game. No subscriptions, no season passes, no premiere packs, no BS. You got all the weapons, all the maps, all the levels, all the modes, and all the joy. It's unfortunate that games withhold what used to be standard features in the name of the holy dollar. I understand that games are expensive to develop, but it has reached a point where players have to call out the developer on Reddit directly because it has gone too far.

Menus made sense back then too. It took my roommate and I 40 minutes and the help of the internet to figure out how to play split-screen multiplayer on CoD WWII. Yet when I flipped on my PS2, we were gunning down foes on Battlefront II in less than five. When did things have to get so complicated? These games are so feature-rich that it loses focus on what really matters - playing the game. Mario Kart moved from simply selecting a character and getting a move on, to choosing a character, a color for them, selecting between a motorcycle or a go-cart, choosing which cart, which wheel type, and a finally glider variation. 

Game makers have also now become so anal about collecting your money that a few games, even when you own the disk, can only be played on a single online account anyway. Games used to be like DVD's, borrowable and playable by anyone who wanted to. As I sit here, my buddy needs to remember his roommates pin-code before it will even open. A pin code? Seriously?

Modern graphics have completely replaced decent storytelling. Some games were so well crafted and written that I cried. Yes, I cried a few times. I laughed too! Over a video-game. See, video-games should be like books - and you are the protagonist. You used to find yourself in an epic tale alongside characters you actually cared about and a quest which outcome mattered to you. Remember when Master Chief found his captain brutally murdered by the Flood? Or when Aerith passed away in FFVII? Or when Sora finally shared the Paopu fruit with Kairi in Kingdom Hearts? And when Shepard and Garrus shot bottles in the citadel like old friends in Mass Effect II - that was a friendship greater than Harry Potter and Ron Weasley. Watching Earth get invaded by the reapers in Mass Effect III was legitimately devastating, as a young boy you tried to save was killed trying to flee London in a shuttle. I wasn't a huge fan of the ending either, but the trilogy as a whole had me engaged the entire time.

The point is, video games have lost everything that was important to them. They moved from an era of ping-pong balls to making friends and building relationships, and right back to ping-pong balls as mindless players fight plot-less enemies to collect loot. They moved from making and breaking friendships on a personal level to voice-chatting with sailor-mouthed 8 year-olds. They moved from catching the small details to including so many features that you don't even know what to do with the game anymore. There's nothing I can do to save the video-game, all I can do now is flip on the PS2 relive the stories that really matter. If you're a developer, I just hope you hear me.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;What has happened to video games?

And when Shepard and Garrus shot bottles in the citadel like old friends in Mass Effect II - that was a friendship greater than Harry Potter and Ron Weasley. Watching Earth get invaded by the reapers in Mass Effect III was legitimately devastating, as a young boy you tried to save was killed trying to flee London in a shuttle. I wasn&amp;#39;t a huge fan of the ending either, but the trilogy as a whole had me engaged the entire time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is, video games have lost everything that was important to them. They moved from an era of ping-pong balls to making friends and building relationships, and right back to ping-pong balls as mindless players fight plot-less enemies to collect loot. They moved from making and breaking friendships on a personal level to voice-chatting with sailor-mouthed 8 year-olds. They moved from catching the small details to including so many features that you don&amp;#39;t even know what to do with the game anymore. There&amp;#39;s nothing I can do to save the video-game, all I can do now is flip on the PS2 relive the stories that really matter. If you&amp;#39;re a developer, I just hope you hear me.&lt;/p&gt;

First person multiplayer shooter version of C&amp;C. It was spectacular.

It was a simple game at a simple time, and I loved the living shit out of it.

Community made a new one that's still in beta called RenegadeX which is quite a nice modernised run of the game, but it has some bugs that is ruining the quality. I guess it sort of depends on what you mean by better. There's no question that graphics, story, etc. are better quality now. That said, some of the classic games did so much with so little and seem to have endless replay ability.I miss Defender.I like the older version of Lara Croft better that's for sure. The reboot version of her just seems like a copy and paste version of a lot of characters from today's fiction like Katniss Everdeen or Ellie from the Last of us. Tomb Raider was a lot more challenging with their puzzles as well and got you to think more. It was more about exploration and less about shooting bad guys. I preferred Lara with the braid and how she kind of had a unique look and personality to her. The Angelina Jolie movies are kick ass as well I think they ""feel"" better because we have so many fond memories attached to them. Memories such as sleepovers with friends you haven't seen in a long time and just simpler times with no responsibilities.I like how you said old games and mention FFX and Jak 2, well PS2 games :P

Personally I always think of Nes to PSX when thinking about old games, The PS2+ era doesn't seem so far...even if it is.

Nonetheless, I don't think gaming is worse or better today. It is different. Where I love the simplicity of older games, like booting of Super Metroid and playing the game after a few mins after the introm, feels good. No online requirement, no download, no long tutorial, etc.

Though games today are just...immersive. Even the worst games can get you hooked if it has the graphics and the right ""cinematic"" elements. King of like Star Wars Battlefront 2, it's not great, but the Star Wars feeling and the graphics, just amazing, gets me hooked.

Only fault today are mostly the copy pasted style of open world and the ""cinematic"" Sony games, those games tend to make me bored, especially open world, so many to play, so little time, but at the same time, they all look and feel and play the same.

Though it is still all better than FF X :P"

I know the processor on the pro is more powerful, but other than getting slightly better FPS, is the graphical change even remotely noticeable on a non 4k TV?I have had a ps4 pro since launch and I can say it is an overall better machine than the launch Ps4 which I also had. It is not as loud and everything seems to run faster on it. I have a 4k TV and the games do look amazingly better but for the most part I play on a 1080p 60hz monitor. Most of the time if a game has a graphics favor mode I dont use it because I prefer smoother gameplay but having the option is nice. Honestly the Pro should be the base model because again it is just an overall better machine. Preordered the ps4 and still own the same one... if sound is your issue try blowing out the interior with an air compressor (maybe a can of compressed air but it's not as powerful). The simple removal of accumulated dust might also improve speed slightly as your ps4's ventilation will improve and it won't overheat as quickly. But hey if you're looking for a tap on the shoulder to upgrade to pro I say take that leap!
I would have upgraded a year back but the fact it doesn’t support 4K disks for movies is weirdYesHonestly if you do not have a 4k tv I don't think it's worth it. I bought one and sold my old ps4 because I knew I was getting a new 4k tv within the month. I had my old tv hooked up to it before my 4k and I really couldn't tell a difference. However, when I got my 4k tv the games that support HDR are really incredible visually.
I wouldn't do it if you're solely trying to mitigate the sound issues. Definitely upgrade if you have a 4K TV; I don't think slightly faster load times justify the purchase either.Is the PS4 slim any better than the OG PS4?  My OG PS4 is bugging out lately and the slim is 100 bucks cheaper than the pro.Yes, better load times, more stable and the games look better even without a 4k tv. "

Open-world games have become a dime-a-dozen really, and shooters still reign supreme. Developers continue to invest their time in the progression of the industry standards, so why then are we so obsessed with the older games, the games of our childhood. Why are we so inclined to go backwards in time? 

For me, it was always games like the Jak and Daxter series holding a special place in my memories, or the sheer joy and nostalgia of any Zelda game, or Mario for that matter, but all that aside, there’s one game in particular that always keeps me coming back for one reason or another.... and that game is Fable. 

Why though? Games have come so far and have become so complex and creative in their structure and mechanics that it’s so easy to become completely invested and lose track of time, this game is so linear, so devoid of complex mechanics or even graphics for that matter, especially for an “RPG”, and so half-cooked that to some it can be laughable at times, so why do I have this obsession? 

Well I believe it’s all these simplicities that keep me coming back, because games have become so complex nowadays, they’ve almost completely lost what video games are meant to bring to our lives; pure fun and simple enjoyment. 
The little quirks and the endless supply of charm this game has to offer always bring me back to simpler times. Now I can’t deny that it has some major flaws or that the sequels were complete garbage, but those flaws have become so much a part of the game I couldn’t imagine playing it without them. 

The average consumer has become so jaded by the quality that the industry is obligated to provide that they forget just what video games are all about, and while I appreciate the effort put into this new-gen standard, it’s always nice to take a step back, and appreciate a game like Fable for what it is, and what it was, instead of what we expect it to be or what it should have been. Go into a game like this with an open-mind, and I guarantee you’ll have a good time. I know that it’s old and it’s seen it’s day, but there’s always something to keep you coming back.

This includes madden,2k, etc...Wasn't it just their stock price?  Did they actually make less revenue and less profit?This statement is a complete fallacy.  You are referring to the company's' valuation - they haven't lost ANYTHING.  It's a public company, they go up and down by a billion in valuation every freaking day the markets are open.  Also note, you have to wait until quarterly reports come out before you actually know whether or not revenues / sales have actually been affected.   Its amazing what they've ""loosed"" Lol.  Welcome to the EA hate circle jerk and yet many people who hate on then  will still buy they next Madden, FIFA or NHL. And for the record, while a 3 billion stock hit is indeed large...it represents less than 10 percent of their market capitalization. We've seen growth and contraction like this before simply from an announcement. So I can pretty much guarantee that the doors are not shuttering anytime soon.  I celebrated when microtransactions got removed from BF2. Jokes on me though, the servers are too laggy to play and I suspect EA is being passive aggressive about this*loses

Makes other companies think twice about ridiculous micro bs usagewell....id say more because they cut the micro transactions and pissed off investors, so they lost 3.1 billion for actually listening for once...Yay everybody loses! Does serve them right, they definitely won’t drop their shitty practices though, just put them on ice until it cools off. Hopefully they’ll get some closer scrutiny from other places now too.

I wouldn't say either of those games were particularly bad. It's just that you have to dig a little deeper to get some fun out of them. No Man's Sky more so.No man’s sky is actually really good now, with their newest update, its a real game, battlefront two has not fixed anything soBatman: Dark Tomorrow was a nightmare.If you have access to older platforms, then Superman 64!!! And also, I second the Sonic from 2006. Nope to hat game.It sounds like you are trying to get enjoyment out of games that were just critically panned because of either bad business practices or misleading buildup. Both games you mentioned are easy to pull enjoyment out of if they are your types of games, even if just for a little.

Go with Superman 64, Big Rigs: Over The Road Racing, or others like that if you're looking for **bad**.You ever play Ride to Hell? Or maybe Aliens Colonial Marines? I’d also suggest MindjackI would say both no man's and battlefront are actually perfectly fine games it took no man's sky 3 years or so to get good but it's very good now. As far as battledront goes you're not playing a bad game just a game made by a bad publisher haha. Do some googling and you could probably find the absolute worst games ever made. I heard the game jumper was horrible that could be a good place to start!Don’t know about those but ‘Jumper: Griffin’s story’ was a disgrace.Dude wtf, an update came out for no mans sky recently and it made the game 1000000x better than at launch.If you want a seriously awful game then play either fortnite or the evil within.Legend of Zelda Wand of GamelonSearch kusoge on google.

Is there anyway we can enjoy his hobby together?,False,"If you're not that good playing video games, you can cooperate with him by planning tasks or tell him what he could do.
For example, games that can require planning or management. I have in mind several games:

**Survival Games** like [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/fr-fr/), [Don't Starve](https://www.klei.com/games/dont-starve), [Terraria](https://terraria.org/); these game are generally slowly paced, that require planning to survive, organize resources, and building stuff. That way you could be the brain and him the muscle (and you can also play with him if you want).

**Cooperative games** In that categorie, I would recommand the mobile/tablet game [SpaceTeam](http://spaceteam.ca/) where the game tell you to input command on a control panel of a ship, but the directives concern the other's player control panel, not yours, requiring your team to shout what they read and hope the concerned player do the thing. I also strongly recommend [Keep Talking and Nobody Explode](http://www.keeptalkinggame.com/), a asymmetric game where you're given instructions to defuse a bomb (that you can print for a more immersive experience), and where the other player must describe what he see on the bomb, to help you deduce what HE should do to defuse the bomb. These games are great for cooperation, laugh and complicity, and doesn't require what you should expect from a ""classic"" video game.

If you want, I could give you some other suggestion of games that are best to be played together and target casual/beginner :)There is definitely a way. I love playing videogames but my boyfriend hadn't played them since he was a kid. Recently, I pulled out all the local co op games I had for switch, ps3, and pc and asked him to pick the ones he was interested in and we would play. Now we have been playing at least once a week! 

I would suggest local-co op rather than online co-op at first. He has been really enjoying playing:
- Warhawk/Starhawk on PS3
- A Way Out on PS4
- Rayman on Nintendo Switch
- Helldivers on PC

When you do move to online  at first stay away from MOBAs (like league of legends, hero of the storm , dota, etc) as the controls and layout is a bit on the complex side. Even if your just versing bots it's very hard to play and try to teach someone how to hold their fingers, look at the map, what skills to use, items to buy,etc.

Good Online ones might be:
- Monster Hunter World
- Final Fantasy: A realm reborn
- various shootersi was expecting someone to say git gud lmao the video game community can be toxicThe trick here is going to be finding a game you're equally skilled at.  
  
So, you may have to play some old school games. Like Tetris (just as an example) Or a game like Mario Kart or a Co-op game like Resident Evil 5 &amp; 6 (will require more skill).  
  
I'm sure you can find some games you're good at if not better than him. Also, you'll get better with practice. Just learn from your mistakes and every time you die, lose a point, lose the game, whatever. Just ask yourself, ""OK, what did I do wrong there and what should I have done?"" Then next time, try to take your own advice and follow through. You could be a natural. ;)   
  
I'm sure other people here can come up with some more examples.  
  
If you don't mind just watching him play, try that. My girlfriend isn't very good at video games either but she loves to watch. Games that tell a good story can still keep you interested and you still spend quality time with him. Start playing together. If he's a dick about it I  any way, dump his ass. You are a tiny baby with all the time in the world to find a good bf.Just like books, there are so many different types of video games out with different ranges of difficulties to learn. Just see whats out on a game website like IGN or the like and try something out. You'll find something you have fun doing and that'll branch out into new things as you find out what you like. 

Also, remember you dont have to enjoy every single thing that your significant other likes. It's perfectly healthy to have your own thing.

GOOD LUCK!!Try Overcooked. Me and my wife played that and she was able to manage the controls. So much fun. 
Alternatively, if you all share a lot of hobbies already, it might be nice for everyone to have something solo that they do.

Even if you fall in love with gaming, you two might have totally opposite tastes in games.  I wouldn't worry about it.  Get into games if you want to buy don't force yourself.  It's supposed to be fun. Especially don't if he's the type that will rage at someone making a mistake.  That will probably be a nightmare for both of you."

I actually keep it installed at all times (I usually uninstall games I'm not playing), because it's a good one to go back to in between games.

Its story is admittedly lacking compared to previous MGS games, but it has some of the best gameplay I've ever experienced.It has some of the best open world gameplay I've ever played, and I've played a lot of open world games.  The story is okay for the first half before turning to shit, but the freedom it gives you more than makes up for itFound it boring and repetitive. Felt like half a game. Love the others in the series to death Long time fan of the series as well. As others are saying it is some of the best open world sandbox gameplay available. I loved the game and will go back to it at some point in the future   for a replay. 

That being said, I've never been blueballed so hard by a story. It is very clear where Konami hit the breaks and said enough Kojima, were releasing this tomorrow. The end is still worth playing through and seeing as it is still some mind blowing Kojima work.

Overall, the price tag will determine how worth it this game is for you. You can generally find it pretty cheap. I think it is worth every penny.

The frustrating part is that this really could have been the best metal gear solid ever if it was given the time to be completed. Damn shame, but it's still a nice installment. "

&gt; It&amp;#039;s hard to remember now, but we&amp;#039;re only four or five years out from widespread and confident predictions that the game console market was effectively dead or dying.

&gt; Around the same time, CNN cited a &amp;quot;Four-year tailspin&amp;quot; in sales for dedicated consoles to explain &amp;quot;Why console gaming is dying.""

&gt; As NPD notes, &amp;quot;Combined sales of PlayStation 4 and Xbox One continue on a record-setting pace&amp;quot; in the US. Together, those &amp;quot;High-end&amp;quot; consoles are selling 18 percent better than the PS3 and Xbox 360 did at the same point in their lifecycles and four percent better than the PS2/Xbox generation.

I miss the days of borderlands, gears of war, and Halo. They all had split screen, but now split screen is dying out. I can't stand it.If you are a proud owner of Xbox one or PC I can recommend you one of my favorite coop games called cuphead. It’s basically a boss battling platformer designed like early 90s cartoons. It is very difficult and it takes a while to get used to controls but if feels very rewarding after defeating a boss. 

Another game I can suggest is diablo 3. It is quiet old but it has PS4 and Xbox one editions. It’s a game developed by blizzard and they are known for supporting their games for years. Graphics are still decent compared to 2017 standards. 

I can also recommend mortal Kombat X. It’s is a fighting game, so I am not sure if you would like to virtually beat up your wife.

If you are looking for more “family friendly” games than consider buying Nintendo switch. It has a very interesting game called “one two switch” Split screen is f-cking amazing. 4 player goldeneye on a projector screenI wound suggest and ea sports (ik its ea) or like halo 1-3. Those were good games. Cuphead is great for just casual playing, but any nintendo switch games are fun, even mario cart on the wii is fun.ScrabbleOf you have a steam link then you could play overcooked Im doing the same thing, getting the wife into gaming. So I'ma getting a switch with Mario Cart. A lot of Nintendo games are good for what you're looking for.Diablo 3  and borderlands are solid co op ones "

It may be fine in this game but other companies need to learn this lesson.Hm, instead, why don't those of us who don't like DLC and microtransactions just not buy games that contain them.Thank you all for your feedback that you have given thus far. Whether it being good or constructive.

Let me just clarify why I would even post this.

This is not for clickbait, or getting ""jimmies"" rustled (although I hope this hits publishers and dev's like who think these business practices are good to a core and hits them hard), I posted this because I was tired of just having conversations about it.

I was tired of having to now fish and sift through all the muck thanks to microtransactions and ""loot."" I was tired of just complaining about it, which I am, on reddit.

The reasoning behind me supporting Monster Hunter World is because of these comments made by a producer of the team. 

Quoting from the Gamespot article titled ""*Monster Hunter World Devs Weigh In On Loot Boxes*"" by Justin Haywald (article author):

**Monster Hunter World, like previous games in the series revolves around killing massive beasts over and over again and then carving them up for the chance to get rare parts to turn into new gear. So loot boxes seem like something Capcom could have considered as a way to give newcomers to the series more chances to get some of the rare loot that otherwise requires lots of luck and even more skill.**

**During a recent preview event, I asked Monster Hunter series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto whether his team ever considered adding loot boxes to Monster Hunter World. ""I think that Monster Hunter has already built that kind of randomized, item reward into the gameplay,"" he answered. ""Whenever you carve a monster after a hunt, you don't know what you're gonna get within a certain range. You've got certain rare parts that you almost never get. You've got some of the ones you don't need that you get a lot of. And then there are the rewards for the quest as well. There are some [rewards] that are standard, there are some that are randomized, and a bit bigger or smaller chance of getting them.""**

**He explained that it just felt like Monster Hunter World doesn't need that kind of system. ""You've already kind of got loot as a core gameplay aspect without having to shove a microtransaction version of it in,"" Tsujimoto said.**

If you don't like the idea of preordering, that's great too (I support that), but the problem is not just preordering, it's people not doing the research  in regards to what will be in a video game.

Now albeit the Destiny 2 XP fiasco is the most disgusting practice by far (right next to EA putting their whole leg in their mouth), people should have learned their lesson after playing the first game, the same goes for Star Wars Battlefront 2.

I have been playing Monster Hunter games since the PSP was ""the handheld"" and fell off after they moved to the nintendo console [but I have Monster Hunter Tri :)]. I know what to expect, and if they do decide to shoe horn microtransactions and the like, after I have made my purchase, then I will never support their product again.

I don't want to give the dev's of Monster Hunter World special treatment at all, but from what they are saying and from what I have played in the past and have seen ([Arekkz Gaming Monster Hunter World Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHc2Wj95htvP9y-ZzibziND5bjPkFkGSs)), my expectation at this point is that I won't be dissappointed.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",0.0,,False,4.0,False,6.0,I'm thinking of not buying games any more that contain micro transactions or loot boxes. What do you guys think?,False,"There are ways to do them without being obtrusive. Rocket League has an OK system. I get loot boxes but never feel like I'm being manipulated into opening them and I can freely trade them with other people even if I don't pay to open them myself. The people that open them usually have dupes of things so I can still get the loot without burning money and the people that want to burn money can do so. 

But then there are games where the fun cosmetic stuff is inaccessible at all without money. Those irk me a little because they intentionally keep you from obtaining anything that looks cool unless you pay, even though you still have access to all the mechanics. 

The ones I hate are ones where you can technically earn the items without paying but it's a massive grind. 

The ones I hate even more are games that actually limit your power unless you pay money - where the best items can only be acquired by spending money. I won't touch those.

These last two are ones I refuse to play because I don't want to support their player numbers. The others I will play, but I never purchase the items. I think that accomplishes the same goal. I feel I'd miss out on too many games if I boycotted micro transactions entirely, but I agree with your philosophy - it's really negatively affected the landscape. It depends for me. If I love the game, I'm perfectly fine with tossing some extra money their way.   

That being said, I wish it wasn't like gambling. Gambling is addictive. You feel like you're so close or the next one will be good for sure. I'll pay for items I want. But I'll overpay for a chance to get an item I want.  

For example, I put maybe $40 into Destiny 2 on silver. All I wanted was an exotic emote. None of m free engrams(and there were tons) gave me them. None of the paid engrams gave me them. And here's my friend over here, has my account set as his home account so he can play. Didn't put a single cent into the game. Got all the exotic emotes from free engrams. Where's the justice in that? By not supporting the game a little more, he was rewarded?  

I'm not saying that players who pay should be rewarded any more than others. But it also kind of deters you from wanting to spend any more money. In a game like Destiny, I think you should be able to buy the items you want. You can't trade them.   

As for games like Rocket League, I'll always keep supporting them. Even though I get garbage from crates, I enjoy opening them. Save me up, buy some keys and open them. Trading in Rocket League is huge. A lot of the money spent on keys goes towards prize pools which is totally fine with me. Because I enjoy watching RL tournaments.  

But when it comes to Shadow of War, I honestly don't know what micro transactions there are. It baffles me. Why would anyone want micro transactions for a single player game? The game should be about the story and the experience. It's not like CSGO or Rocket League, where you have these items that you can show off online. Specifically because those games don't have a campaign. Shadow of War is entirely a campaign.  

So, I didn't really answer anything. But that's my perspective on it. Not exactly a micro transaction,but it discourages me to buy and brand new game and immediately (and sometimes beforehand) see a ""season pass"" for sale. You are already planning new content to charge us for?

Sometimes I get it. Fallout, the Witcher, Skyrim, and other games that add new areas and massive amounts of content are great. But just the fact that they announce these things before people even get to play the game, to decide whether they like the game or even want more content, is a deterrent for me.

Focus on the main game, create solid mechanics, flesh everything out, THEN move on to extra content.Do it"

So when it comes to casual and child friendly games you really can’t beat the mobile/tablet market. Alternatively the Nintendo 3DS can play older DS games and that has plenty of things such as Bejeweled and the like. In terms of a console I unfortunately can’t recommend any of the current gen right now for casual gaming, the Xbox One has a game pass feature which is a bit like Netflix for games but I’m not sure of what’s available on it. However might be worth investigating!Here's my idea. Get an Xbox 360. All the games are pretty cheap and one can still get games of many kinds online.

The library is a bit limited but it's growing, and casuals come by the dozen since it's ""family oriented"".  
Or even a Wii, casual ""non gamers"" love that motion control and the library is massive.

Stardew Valley, nuff saidIf you are into JRPG (Japanese Role Playing Games), i recommend Tales of Berseria for the PC or I think Xbox One. (I gotta check on that one.) It has a kick ass story, easy controls, and the characters are memorable. There are more Tales of games but that's the only one that comes to mind. Dark soulsFortnite, I personally don’t play it because it’s trash but a lot of people who haven’t played much before love thisgame Every gamer has different taste. Some like racing some like shooters some like arcade and some like simulators. You'll need to find out what you like.

I would recommend The Witcher 3 for story and mechanics. You might be lost with some parts of the story in terms of characters but you'll pick it up.

GTA5 is a good one also, simple to understand and the controls are intuitive but somewhat complex. Good to prep you for other action based games.

Giving racing games a try. Maybe story driven games like ""Life is Strange"".

If you're bf is like most guys, get into sports games. It's the best fun when you match up against someone equal to your skill. You'll need to build up your skill for sure but the more you play with people better than you, the quicker you'll get better.Hi! 

My SO and I currently play Yoshi's woolie world. Cuteness overload. A fun, have-a-good-time platformer, with an option to make it easy (wings). Good entry into some other platformers perhaps?

Also, if you want to check out some oldies, Point&amp;Click adventures are a lot of fun. Simon the Sorcerer, Maniac Mansion / Day of the Tentacle, Monkey Island, Sam &amp; Max, BASS, Indiana Jones... Many of these are playable free or cheap now (via ""ScummVM"" that runs on anything from PC to toaster). Less skill based, more fun! :-)

And more ""modern"" titles such as ""Life is Strange"" (you can reverse the time, sometimes correct mishaps, or ...),...

And Zelda- Breath of the wild, just because it's so much fun :3

Have fun!Try danganronpa trigger happy havoc &amp; Phoenix Wright stuff. No need to play skill intensive games and they’re great to play together due to visual novel style. I have a blast figuring out who dunnit when I played with my partner. 
Kirby games are relatively forgiving and often two player. The call of duty games campaigns have settings to be really easy or really hard Siege is great if you like team play games like over watch and all that. It does have a pretty steep learning curve bc of all the maps and the unique op skills. But it’s hella fun!Metro 2033 and Metro Last Light (and soon to release Metro Exodus).

I only have a PC and they have an Xbox one, but I'm wary of buying any console to play with them as I lack discipline and do well with video game consoles haha. But I think this will be the best way of entering their lives more and being able to discuss daily things and give advice and guidance.

The only games I know they like are Fortnite and the Lego games. Both of which I despise -\_- The battleroyale set-up drives me nuts, as its a crazy amount of time spent getting to the action and then you die far too easily to enjoy, IMO.

I'm willing to git gud at anything that may be best, but that's the vein I prefer.

I deeply enjoy it however it maybe too far on the sandbox side. Cloudberry Kingdom, Battle Block Theater, and heavy weapon are some fun side scrolling type games which are very fun, however if I'm being honest I dont know about there connectivity over xbox live as I have always just played them with friends sitting next to me. Castle crashers is another good one that I know you can play online together as well as happy wars and dungeon defenders. Those are all pretty fun games that arent unnecessarily violent or gory. Since you did mention fallout some other good ones are grand theft auto 5, titan fall 2, 7 days to die, how to survive 2, rainbow six siege, and my personal favorite ark survival evolved but I usually play on pc and I wouldn't suggest doing an official online server (instead do an exellerated rates unofficial server) hope this helps!!If you enjoy Overwatch then tell your cousin's to get Overwatch. I told my younger cousins to get Overwatch and now from time to time we play it."

He is at the end of the first stageChrono Trigger has like 4 points you can fight the last boss, one of them with only two characters in the very beginning of the game ( a new game+ bossfight, practically impossible otherwise) The first two Fallout games allow you to move anywhere on the world map without barriers.

Religious themes enhance my gameplay experience by adding a (usually) ancient and mysterious power that either helps or hinders your progress, and also gives lesser beings (normally humans, or whatever race the playable character is) a guiding voice.

I have a couple favourite games with religious themes. My favourite game of all time is Dark Souls, which features a bunch of different religious aspects. A few others are Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, Demon's Souls, The Last of Us, Bloodborne, and Horizon Zero Dawn. These games, while all containing some element of religion, explore the ideas very differently, which is a large part of what drew me to them.

I do not identify as religious. If I had to put a label to it, I would probably say that I am agnostic: the existence of a God or Gods is unknowable. The part of a well-made video game religion that I enjoy is that it often makes you think about real-life questions and beliefs. For example, in *Bloodborne,* the Doll (a character whose main function is levelling up your playable character) states:

*""Hunters have told me about the church. About the gods, and their love. But... do the gods love their creations? I am a doll, created by you humans. Would you ever think to love me? Of course... I do love you. Isn't that how you've made me?""*

It makes you think: if there is a God, do they love us as much as we ""were made"" to love them? The Doll acknowledges that she was made to love humans, but does not know if we love her the same way.

Religious sacrifice is something that has taken place throughout most of human history, and thus I believe it is an effective way for a game to show importance and hierarchy, even if the reason has been long since lost to the people performing the sacrifice. Games tend to have an unclear history, simply saying that religions and traditions began ""long ago."" In *Horizon Zero Dawn,* we play as Aloy, a girl without a mother and even worse, a totally unknown origin. As we travel through the world that's been artificially created probably hundreds of years after the demise of original humanity, we witness a number of different types of religions, including ones that practice sacrifice. We begin in the Sacred Lands, the land of the Nora. They are an isolated hunter-gatherer tribe, though they are not nomadic. They worship old machinery in the mountain known as All-Mother, and because they do not understand how the machinery works, it is given religious features. Throughout history, humans have used religion to explain that which they did not understand. The Nora's blind reverence of All-Mother mirrors our own reverence of an unseen power who we deem to be in control of our environment, our bodies, and our health.

Later in the game, we are introduced to the Carja, who worship the Sun. When we meet them, they are actually a friendly and fairly advanced people - their understanding of machinery, while not perfect, is much higher than the Nora. However, the history given to us during the game tells us that the ruler of the Carja used to be brutal and bloodthirsty: the 13th Sun-King Jiran believed that the Derangement, a phenomenon in which the machine-animals were becoming increasingly violent, was caused because humans were not giving the Sun its proper respect. He then began the Red Raids, which included capturing and sacrificing humans from neighbouring tribes in hopes to appease the Sun. As we learn later, the Derangement was brought on by a piece of code implemented to self-destruct life on Earth should it be deemed not good enough running rampant. Jiran had no way to know this, and turned to human sacrifice in hopes of bringing peace back to the land.

An incredibly interesting and perhaps under-explored aspect of religion in video games is how it is used to ""explain"" mental health. The game *Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice* explores this theme to a great extent and has been a fantastic discussion starter. Senua, a Pictish warrior, suffers from depression and psychotic mental illness that manifests in visual and auditory hallucinations. Because she lives in a time before any study on the brain had been done, it's not acknowledge that she has an illness, but rather it is believed the Gods are punishing her. Her father, the cause of a majority of her anxiety, tells her that her ""darkness"" is a punishment and it is unlikely that she will ever overcome it. However, as we progress through the game and get more glimpses into her past, we see almost precisely where her problems originated and are magnified. She shares the psychosis with her mother, who was also tortured and cut down by Senua's father. When Senua was five, she witnessed her father burn her mother alive in order to save their family from her ""darkness."" When Zynbel (Senua's father) identified that Senua had the same illness as her mother, he believed it needed to be beat and bled out of her. This is the second exacerbation of her madness: her father, a once loving figure, isolating and torturing her in an attempt to appease the Gods. 

Later, Senua met a lover named Dillion. Her hallucinations have not stopped, so in order to try and save Dillion from her darkness and potentially rid herself of her terrifying visions, she journeys by herself into the Wilds. In doing so, she meets a scholar named Druth who had once been captured and tortured by a violent tribe of Northmen. He brought their atrocities to life by telling her their stories and myths. Druth eventually died in the Wilds, but his voice had been added to the many that already lived in her head.

In returning to her village, she found that it had been attacked by the very Northmen Druth had told her about. She ran in to find more heartbreak: Dillion had been killed by blood-eagle, and many more from her village had been strung up in a big tree and set aflame. This is the final straw, and Senua's mind is broken. Her psychosis is almost unstoppable and she suffers from terrifying visions constantly. Because of her father and Druth's stories, she believes the reason for all these horrors is because she has been cursed by the Gods. In reality, she started with a mild case of psychosis that was exacerbated through abuse, violent and gruesome imagery, and depression and guilt. *Hellblade* is a fascinating study because of how much research the development team put into mental illness and how they tied it into Norse mythology.

*The Last of Us* explores religion in a completely different way from anything we've seen so far. In *The Last of Us,* the Earth has suffered a cordycep outbreak which has essentially turned the majority of humans into zombies. This is the closest to a ""real world"" scenario we've explored so far.  Humanity has not actually experienced a zombie outbreak, but the game takes place on Earth, only a few years into the future. There are characters who have lived during our own present day and remember what life was like before the outbreak. As time passes and people begin to recreate their own settlements, life begins to return to normal - as normal as it can be within the confines created by a world crawling with cordycep-infected zombies. Eventually, there are people born into these settlements who did not know what life in the old world was like, and those who do have that experience can use it to their advantage. Their life becomes almost mystical simply by having lived through the outbreak that changed the world.

Near the end of the game, Ellie (one of our main playable characters) meets a man named David who, unbeknownst to us, is a leader in one of these relatively new settlements. Because of the dangers presented by wandering zombies, the settlement has to turn to whatever means it can to find food: cannibalism. David presents himself in an almost holy way, providing food for his people. Eating is a practice done together and the inhabitants revere David for his ability to find them food. Some of the younger members may not even know that eating humans was once widely taboo. By providing human flesh for the population of his settlement, David has achieved the status of a living deity and rules easily over a decently large population. This just goes to show how quickly a religion will be instated in the face of immense danger: by becoming a guiding light, David has created a settlement in a volatile world, though its cannibalistic foundation is looked down upon in our own worldview.

Get yourself a PS2 emulator. And grab The Dark Alliance, I can guarantee you’ll love it. In addition a game that I like even better than this that is pretty much the same thing is called Champions: Return to arms. 

Seconding Divinity as it is a blessing to the top down rpg world and is probably exactly what you want. 

Of course if you’ve never played Portal 2 together you should, it’s hella fun. 

Other recommendations:
Crawl (personal favourite but more entertaining with 3-4 people)
Nidhogg 
Risk of Rain
Chariot
Castle Crashers
Lovers in a dangerous spacetime
Forced 
Speedrunners
Victor Vran (like baldur’s gate)
The Trine series (the last one sucks tho)

All of these games have Couch Co-OpNot really 2 players but you can always take turns.

Little Nightmares is amazing. If you have Steam Fran Bow is great too. I personally loved playing Divinity Original Sin with my husband, though that is a completely different style of game. Alienation is a decent game that plays more similarly to Diablo. Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light is a fun adventure/puzzle game. if you really want to test your self cup head is great 
You might like don't starve together, two player rogue-like survival gameBorderlands 2You guys should look into subscribing to final fantasy 14 online. If you like playing that together you will love this game! My wife and I play together every day. It's a never ending game so you're good for ever lol.

If you end up doing it mssg me I'll tell you what server I'm on and we can all have fun together!I will talk to him when he gets home. Sounds fun.It might take some getting used to, but World of Warcraft is like the ultimate version of Diablo."

Like, I'll admit that I listen to 8 bit music and watch old movies for Nostalgia's sake. I even enjoy 8 bit versions of modern themes like this one for example from the hobbit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sUQHHdvFCc

But I think there's something deeper than Nostalgia that drives us to look back at the good 'ol days of gaming as better than what we're dealt today.

*Available Disk Space.*

I think the fact that developers were limited with what they were able to fit on a disk/cartridge made them choose WHAT they fit on that disk/cartridge a little bit more wisely.

As a result, we got more WELL THOUGHT OUT games. Compare today's Star Wars Battlefront(s) with the original Star Wars Battlefront I &amp; II. I mean I'm sure you can think of a million examples of this.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",0.0,,False,8.0,False,5.0,Did available disk space kill video games?,False,"The advent of the internet, allowing companies to patch games after release, has definitely had a huge impact on overall polish of games at release (looking at you Ubisoft).

The advent of the internet is also at fault for DLC.  In the olden days, if a company wanted to release more content for a game it had to be worth the cost of disk and packaging so the added content tended to be expansion sized rather than a single solitary mission, a weapon, and a completely useless cosmetic item for $10.

Basically, the internet ruined the integrity of the gaming industry.I think the issue is much like what happened with films, the focus has shifted to graphics/visuals, making something that can be marketed, and mimic elements found in other financially successful releases.

Look at video game and movie announcements from major studios. Both promise these grand premises, they show us selective little pieces to leave us salivating and talking. The buzz causes people to start fantasizing on what the final product will be and practically selling it to ourselves. It's only once we bought the movie ticket or game that we realize the reality.

Sure upcoming games received hype back in the day, but it was reading an article in Nintendo Power and not being blasted by articles, social media, youtube channels, commercials etc. Developers were excited to try new things and explore new fronts. Teams were small and games didn't take years to make so there was a much lower financial investment and risk.

I honestly believe a publisher would rather have an average game with great marketing potential versus a great game with average marketing potential. Sure if a game becomes a hit and it well received then it's just icing on the cake, but they want pre-orders and big day 1 sales numbers because that's how they are judged by their bosses and shareholders. 

I remember playing Alien Isolation and thinking to myself....MY GOD, it feels like a publisher didn't try to interfere with development. I'm like how did someone in a suit and tie not demand there needed to be ""more aliens, more guns, multiplayer, and a build your own space station element"". It was such a refreshing feeling but guess what, it's sales were poor (at least in Sega's eyes) despite positive reviews from critics and fans. So just like movies being good alone isn't what gets you the money, you have to be able to market it to create demand.

This to me is the difference between those hit retro games versus what we have now.Until you watch things like gaming documentaries where they tell you what an abuse machine game creation was and how some of the greatest games were churned out way too fast by people who didn't really get any piece of the massive sales. It's always been this way.

I dont think it's so much ""how can we make the best game with this limited space?"", but ""how can we obtain the most money using what space we have?"".Regarding disk space, I feel like the updates full of crap that costs money is what's killing it for me. I see all of these huge (in terms of disk space) updates being forced down our throats with no in game changes to show for it. And the fact that its a pain, or down right impossible, to opt out of it speaks volumes to where the industry is heading. "

I guess my answer would be, as far as not being depressed, that I’m sure the dudes who made Fallout started out with an interest in coding and tried making their own games, figured out what they were good at, and steadily improved. Maybe think of what you’re doing now as rough drafts, as building your portfolio, as putting in the elbow grease. Then, when an opportunity comes along, you’re more equipped to take advantage of it than all the other people who just got disheartened and gave up.

You can do it, OP!"

\*affect

I consider video games art and I'm sure everyone agrees that art can affect people in different ways. I play lots of violent video games, but I'm a pacifist in real life. I'm sure there are people whose violent impulses are exacerbated by violent video games.

Another example of art affecting people differently is Charles Manson. I listened to The Beatles' *White Album* and enjoyed some good tunes; Charles tried to start a race war.Everything can. How many wars were waged over books? How terrible is the music people listen to? Millions of people are exposed to the same media that the killers are. Needing better mental health evaluation starting are earlier ages is the real problem that violent video games expose. "

Maybe it&amp;#39;s just due to having a 4 person team rather than running through the stages as just Kirby. What do you guys think? Has anyone played it? Is it worth it? &lt;/p&gt;

It's not the hardest kirby game out there, but Kirby games have never been hard.  My strategy is to mostly solo or duo it with the AI.  If you absolutely _need_ three helpers at any point, the game will continuously spawn helpers so you can capture them.  Going with on my own or with only one helper has made the game more fun.  I make a point to do each boss completely solo.  Plus, the post-game stuff is pretty great and has been eating up my time quite a bit.

In short, I have no regrets purchasing this game!  I am still enjoying it, and I bought it on launch day.  "

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",0.0,,False,14.0,False,5.0,REDDIT DEBATE: Males playing as female characters and vice versa,False,"None of this matters, but I'll bite. How you choose to play a game is your choice. There can be so many potential reasons to pick a gender in a game, that trying to tie it down to ""that guy must be socially awkward nerd"" holds no water. 

That being said, I'm a socially awkward male nerd that chooses to play a female character maybe about 70% of the time. So I guess I fit the trend. 

Been playing a lot of fallout 4 recently and frankly the female voice actor knocks the socks off the male. And (SPOILER WARNING for Fallout 4) I feel like playing the mother in this game gives so much more meaning to your time spent in game searching for your son. There can be quite a few reasons to play as a character that's either the same gender or different from the player.  While using the player character as a direct surrogate is one motivation, you also have plenty of others including control (I want to have this character do something), escapism (I want to experience something different from real life), comedy (wouldn't it be funny if the character was this or that), and the list goes on.

Projection onto the character happens pretty universally; you'll almost never hear someone talking about what the character did (unless it's during a cutscene or something similar) but will instead hear them talk about game experiences in the first person.  Just because people project onto the character, however, does not necessarily mean they identify with all the aspects of that character.  In this example, a guy playing a female character does not necessarily indicate he identifies as female on some level (although that can be the case).

At the end of the day it all comes down to the individual and personal taste.  Sometimes I'll play a male character that I can really project myself onto, sometimes I'll play a female character because having a girl with twig arms swinging around a giant sword is kinda funny.  In another game I might play a male character because the character model and equipment looks awesome, and in yet another a female character because the character looks attractive.  Trying to lump everything together and say everyone who plays as a character of a different gender secretly identifies as that gender (or to try to argue the opposite) is really pretty pointless.So obviously, in a lot of games, you're not going to have a choice. But in games that you do have a choice in, you typically get more benefits of playing as one gender over another. For example, female characters in Skyrim have speech bonuses while males have strength advantages. I've played as both but as a woman, I always gravitate toward playing as a female, to be honest. When I've played as a male, it's not been any sort of aesthetic or subconscious motive, it's because you start out with a greater carry capacity. Welp, I'm a guy and I have all my life played female characters, from Daisy in Mario Party to Jinx in LoL going through playing a female character in every MMO I've played. For me it's just that I don't identify with these big hunky macho men and I prefer playing as something that appeals more to me. Also I'm gay, so there's that, but I don't think it has anything to do, if there were male characters I could identify with I'd play them but there aren't. Then I've also always thought there's more originality in female character designs.I definitely play as a girl cause im gayAs a lady, I generally play as a male character.  Mostly because the armor designs are cooler and I'd rather stare at a sexy guy for 200 hours.As a cis gendered, non trans male, I always role play as a female as its the only chance I will get or ever want in life. I’ve always heard guys play as females bc the characters hit box is smaller for pvp play.For me, the deciding factor is the game and what the impact on gameplay will be. As a girl, I usually play as a female character, though there are times where I go with a guy because I think he looks cooler. Usually if I’ve completed a game and replay it later, that’s when I’ll make a switch in my characters gender. I think it’s just to see if there is a difference in gameplay.If I do a second playthrough, I always play as the opposite sex of my first playthrough. It's funny that people even think anything about it at all. I never gave it more thought than the fact that I wanted to see if the game and npc's act any differently. I'm a girl and I choose female characters whenever possible (for example GTA online) but playing as a male character in other games never bothered me. I actually like putting myself in their shoes maybe because I personally enjoy being a bit masculine irlI definitely work with some guys that would not even play a game that has a main female character. Like Mirrors Edge or Tomb Raider because they could not comprehend playing as a female character

I was shocked, because i usually play as female characters because the idea of a woman of color doing a bunch of heroic things is bad ass. "

Resolution also changed, the NES is 256 x 240 and most games now use 1080p and over. So the pixelated looks needs to be ""emulated"" versus native in the older games.There are 3 reasons why they may do it. 
1. You are able to add more content to a game if you don't focus so much on graphics.

2. It triggers a feeling of nostalgia among many older gamers as it reminds them of the games they played in their childhood.

Theyre so cheap nowadays and will do everything you need it to. Every game you will every need comes out on it. This is seriously your best option. Gaming had never been cheaper than right now.Go to ebay and there is a game8ng computer for 400$ and it comes with a gtx 1050 in it with 15 gigs of ram buy rust or battlegrounds or whatever games your into and start from there Xbox is the place for racing games. Get an Xbox 360 or am Xbox One and get a Forza game.If you're just dabbling, I would say grab a 360 and a bunch of great deals on games. I love the controller and there is a massive library. And GTA 5 is on there. You could probably get a pretty good size collection for$350. If you do want to step into the newest generation, I recommend the Xbox One over PS4. Primarily because if you're on a budget for games the Xbox Live Gold gets you free games (so does the PS Plus, but if your membership lapses with Xbox the games are all still playable) and you can get 13 months of Live for around $43 on sale. I play my Xbox One much more than my PS4. I just think it's a great system if you are jumping back in. An Xbox One S can be had with a game or two for a little over $200. That'll give you plenty for some more games. And there are some killer sales right now. Anywho, hope some of this helps. Happy Holidays. :)With God of War right around the corner(4/20) I'd pick up a PS4.  That would be a good reintroduction to games as it's supposed to be incredible.With Sony as your base. I strongly suggest a PS4 Pro if you have a 4K TV. Lots of games will feel right at home with your previous experience and you can download a lot of old ps1 and ps2 games you may be really familiar with if you feel the itch to go back. I recently replayed San Andreas and had no problem getting back into it on my PS4, especially since the graphics were converted to HD. Build a PC.  You pay more but you grt upgradability much better multifunctionality not to mention you can do your own maintenance.  PS4 Xbox whatever =expensive dust collectors. I'd say get a PS3. It's cheap, has free online services, and has great games. As for games get Red Dead Redemption, and Fallout 3 and or Fallout New Vegas. The Last of Us, Bioshock 1 or infinite, Uncharted 2, Borderlands, Dead Space are good options also.

There are good shooting &amp; racing games on 360 which will keep you busy for another 2 years. Comparing to PS4 the game price are also very low."

7ktfc3,4.0,0.0,,,"Hi! 

So my partner is the anxious type. He worries and stresses a lot in his day to day life - over the big things (like where are we gonna live when our contract is up) and small things (this person didn't use the same emojis as usual they must be mad at me). 

So whenever he has a new game going on I'm so happy for him that there's something that makes him feel good and stuff. 

It's just... whenever he has a new game, he'll play the new one non stop, and rather than stress about IRL things, get stressed, anxious and irritable about the game. 

Like he'll be sweating as he plays, his neck muscles get knots from the tension, and he gets really snappy if he's playing a high stress course; and if it doesn't go well especially. 
But also about things like always having charge in his phone (the last three games have been the kind you play on your phone) 

Am I just being the typical non gaming partner and worrying too much? How much stress is a video game supposed to add to your life? Or does being stressed about games make you feel less stressed about other things? 


(I've tried to talk to him about it but it's an incredibly sensitive topic - I'm pretty sure he wasn't allowed to play as a kid or had very strict rules about it since he reacts as if me bringing it up even in the most non aggressive way is criticism)

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",0.0,,False,9.0,False,4.0,How to support a partner who stresses a lot over video games?,False,"I think the most important question is, is it bothering you? Are they stressing you out?

It isn't good behavior, coming from someone who plays video games all the time and has been doing so for almost all their life.

Getting angry at a frustrating game is typical, but it shouldn't go too far.

I'll be honest and I don't mean to be rude, but I think this person has a problem. Maybe try to get them to talk about it? It might help with the anxiety. If anything, at least let them know you are there for them. As someone who plays a lot of video games and has a tendency to obsess over some things (I have moderate OCD), I understand that sometimes seemingly trivial things can be bothersome. That being said, that level of stress is still in no way normal or healthy, even from my perspective. Video games are supposed to be relaxing (with a few exceptions), so responding to them by getting so stressed out is definitely a problem.

I know you said it's a sensitive issue, but you and your partner need to sit down and have an honest conversation about finding a way to better manage his stress, for the benefit of his health and your relationship. If that proves to be ineffective, I wouldn't rule out professional counseling. I hope everything works out okay.No, this isn't normal or healthy. I'm not qualified to be sure, but this is the internet so I'll say it. It sounds to me like he may have either an addictive personality that is manifesting in this right now, but could be worse in future, and/or an anxiety problem that he directs at the games. Either way, the games may not be healthy for him, but more importantly, he is likely experiencing a larger problem.Games can be stressful, some are designed that way (Dark Souls, Bullet-Hell type games, hard stealth games) but I feel like games should never get to the point where someone is hard to talk to because a game is stressing them out. I overstress a lot of things too, Games are what I use to calm down. I think seeking some professional help about his stress and anxiety might be good for him. I get having your stomach in knots during a tense fight or a very close important race, but if games are putting him through physical stress like that I think he needs some help, and it may not be something you can give him directly.Im not even trying to be funny or anything when I say this but maybe he should smoke a joint?

I play games non stop while taking care of my kids (4 in total) and not to mention all the other things going on in my life right now I'll tell ya, I have a lot of damn stress. I've recently started smoking pot and im waaayyy less stressed about shit and I have more fun in return.Video Games are supposed to be something to take stress away Not add to it. Sure certain levels agitate you but I'd never say it stresses me out. It sounds like he needs something to RELAX like taking a walk through a forest or something nice. Adding stress to stress doesn't cancel it out. Also that sort of lifestyle sounds a little unhealthy.I'll occasionally swear and yell at a game and my wife will poke fun at me but it's all in fun I don't let it carry over into my relationship I'm frustrated at the game not at her and usually it's best if your getting stressed to that point take a breather maybe a hour or a day or so and I've found most times that solves situation as stressing at a game can impare your skills. However if a game is causing that much grief maybe try a different game maybe that ones not for him...there are plenty of games and plenty of genres....best of luck stay positive"

I took a big hiatus on gaming where i either didnt game at all or just used my 3ds, ds lite, or gba sp. I have owned (and foolishly got rif of) a pretty good retro gaming collection and resent the few digital games i have. With so many games requiring same day patches i shudder to think about what this generation's 'retro gaming' would look like. I take forever to finish a game, if i ever do, and often replay them. Digital copies are also either the same priceor comparable to a ful priced game.
Phsyical copies take up less space on your console and are less impermanent. I will always prefer a phsyical copy for these reasons.I prefer digital, but I hate that that means I have to pay more for games.  It’s insane how fast prices drop on physical copies of games now, but digital stays full price, sometimes for years after a game releases.Physical Physical. No contest."

Overwatch is at least a more unique experience than CoD, and the ability to play different roles in the team makes it more engaging imo. But, CoD has single player, if that matters to you. If you're willing to wait a week before making your decision, Overwatch is going to be free to play next weekend, so you can try it for yourself and see if you like it.Overwatch is a jack of all trades kind of game. There’s something there for everyone in the FPS genre.If you ever played team fortress 2, overwatch is pretty similar. It's is very fun but I get bored faster with it tbh.

It is also more on the competitive side. Cod is my ""I want to couch potate today"" game and is fulfilling that need of not really thinking and trying too hard.

Ultimately it's up to what you are looking for.

Competitive and much more fast paced = overwatch

To potate around, play campaign, zombies etc = cod. "

The camera movement is silky smooth.

The lighting blends really well with the assets, but I'm guessing the lighting is handled in programming, right?

I'm looking at MMO games on Steam, and what's the Top Seller?  ARK.  Is Ark an MMO?  I don't really think so.  It's got a persistent world and a bunch of players can play on a single server (64 I think?).  But that's not what makes something an MMO.
  
I mean, I come from a generation, where MMOs were defined by games like Eve Online, Everquest (original), Anarchy Online, Lineage, Star Wars Galaxies, City of Heros and Planetside.  An MMO was a game that had a massive number of players (typically, hundreds to thousands at once), not this new ""64 play instanced persistent world"" stuff.  
  
Don't mistake me for someone who dislikes ARK, it's a pretty enjoyable game, but it's not an MMO.  I've been looking for a good new ""MMO"" experience for awhile but all I seem to run are games like Ark, Life is Feudal, Rust, and a handful of other games classified as ""MMO"", some even calling themselves MMORPGs.  I mean, as far as I can tell, a game that limits a server to 64 players are focuses on crafting and survival (as well as PVP), isn't an MMORPG.  
  
It seems to me, that the traditional MMO and MMORPG experience is being lost to time.  I mean, I remember back in the glory days of Everquest or City of Heros, where people actually Roleplayed within an MMORPG (imagine that!).  Now, even the RP servers on many games have been merged into PVE servers.  
  
This may be a bit of a rant, but I feel like traditional MMORPGs and the traditional experience those games brought, is something we are going to lose soon (with the new micro-transaction focus games are taking), and I think that gaming itself is going to be lesser for it.  Intentional or not, we are trading the experience of games that were once monumental and boasted epic battles and stories where you made friends and enemies everywhere as you interacted with hundreds of people for these small 64 player server games that have dozens (if not hundreds) of empty servers with others never going above 10 or 15 players at once.  
  
It just feels to me, that the direction ""MMO"" gaming is going is going to leave us with more detailed survival and crafting simulators, but at the cost of something that (to me at least) once was truly marvelous.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To me, MMOs have always been games which were Massively Multiplayer Online Games, but now it seems like anyone who makes a game with even the slightest hint of &amp;quot;online&amp;quot; can throw themselves into the category.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",0.0,,False,7.0,False,16.0,"Does it concern anyone how ""MMO"" has changed in definition?",False,"I think games like ARK in a sense are the next generation of MMO even though they dont really deserve the title of MMO. With more people wanting faster fps type games I dont think developers want to make a traditional MMO it doesnt seem like it would sell in today's market and its a shame. A shame that most company's rather make money than a quality game and a even bigger shame that true MMOs in a sense are dying off.

A lot of bigger company's that made great MMO have ether died off or changed to something else for example Blizzard and WoW once one of the biggest MMOs out there and now there new golden child being Overwatch a semi typical fps.ARK is more than 64, official server limit is 70 but I've seen servers with well over 100 max players.

I don't think there was ever a hard definition of what makes something ""massive"". ARK has a massive world, whether 100+ people is massive is debateable, does it mean always available? Many ARK servers are online 24/7, including the official ones.

I always thought the more defining feature of MMOs was the open-ended online structure. While in a traditional ""multiplayer"" game you connect to other players manually or through structured matchmaking logic, in an MMO you are just ""in it"" with other players as soon as you connect to a server - the whole world connected - indifferent to the game's given goal - and persistant.

ARK it's not an MMO**RPG** - at least not by standard genre definitions, but if you're playing on a always-on server (like many do) it could be considered a massive multiplayer online game.

Either way, I don't see how it could be concerning. ARK is not cutting into the MMORPG market, it caters to a different genre interest. It's much more Minecraft than World of Warcraft. MMO is a buzzword and I don't think it ever really meant anything super specific anyways.Can we call them MOs? Or OMs? "

So a game that was realistic?I think a game where you're part of an organization that wants to undermine a part of the United States infrastructure would be really fun and engaging. 

But xcountry vs US, yeah, I'd still play. Unless it involved shooting American soldiers, then I'd just feel uncomfortable. Sure as hell would, as a guy not from the USA. It would show the perspective of soldiers from different other countries and also show Americans how it feels like to shoot the (virtual) soldiers of your own countryI always wondered what it would be like to play Freedom Fighters as the Soviet forces or if such a game like that exists.

Yes.I actually thought about this a lot before. Maybe like a WWI/WWII game where you are a German and you were humiliated from WWI and follow Hitler into WWII. It sounds kind of messed up, but I would probably play it. (As long as my character didn't have to kill Jewish people)We need a game like this to shake things up. I mean hell, name an fps focused on modern day warfare made recently that didn't involve running around as team USA shooting racial stereotypes most of the time.

(I know shooters exist where you don't do that a majority of the time, but it seems to be a prevalent thing in modern shooters, whether intentionally or not.)It's called Fallout. Look it up.What about spec ops the line? "

I'm not sure if they are sold everywhere but in the gardening/tools section if you are looking hard enough, you'll see a little polar bear push light.

We disassembled the light, put in AAA batteries and only use the innards of the light without the polar bear casing. I'll post more info soon on the brand etc. but the pad is pressure sensitive so you can just put it on and the light will turn on. It's pretty effective and cost effective compared to other lights I've seen used. 

Edit: my deepest apologies, living in a populated house means things get thrown away on accident sometimes. I will try to find the light when I'm at the 99 cent store again and post it here as soon as possible, thanks for the patience if anyone has been waiting.

4c1gfn,12.0,0.0,,,"I am an old gamer who always complains about today's games. The main answer I get from people is ""like everyone, you remember the games you played when you were young more fondly"". That's bullshit. My ability to evaluate - and enjoy - games has refined rather than the opposite, and even today I find games I enjoy.

Here I'm going to explain exactly what happened to the game industry.

My point is, when people ask us old gamers what exactly was better in old school games, we find hard to word it. That's because it's not something tangible like graphics, duration or size of the world. It is something that's more important than all of this to works of imagination: SOUL, VISION, or whatever you want to call it.
Today, when you play a new game, you feel like you bought a new electric razor or mixer. It's better engineered than the previous one, and it certainly has some new features, but it's hardly going to give you any emotions.
You get the feeling people had to create a new product, so they tried to figure out what was cool/successful.
But works of creation dont work like industrial products. There is something peculiar to works of creation that is hard to recreate industrially.
The reason why Star Wars is Star Wars, and other 192415175157 scifi movies are not. The reason why Blade runner is Blade runner, Alien is Alien, Lord of the Rings is Lord of the Rings, Apocalypse now is Apocalypse now etc. And those reasons are called Philip K. Dick, J.R.R. Tolkien, Ridley Scott, F. Ford Coppola etc. The reason is that behind those work of arts there's a great creative mind that had a vision. No one asked Tolkien to spend decades studying the mythology of ancient peoples. He didn't expect to make any money out of it. He did it because he had a passion for it.
Once, when people decided to make a new game, it was because they had an IDEA. No one made videogames to become rich, because it was very hard to become rich with videogames. It was a niche industry. People who did it was passionate. They loved games   themselves. They were mainly fantasy-scifi-rpg-computer-history-whatever nerds who spent all their time thinking about how to best represent the feeling of flying on an x wing or fighting a dragon or even just playing a tabletop game on computers. 

Then what happened is what happens every time an industry grows: businessmen took control. They said ""ok kids, you amateurs  did a good job, but now it's a grown men game, leave it to someone who can handle it"".
Businessmen don't care about games, just like they don't care about canned soup, mobiles, or whatever they sell. They only care about money, revenue on investment and minimizing loss. Of course, the old school heroes, big name auteurs and developers were kept in the industry, but the pressure of the corporate environment reportedly crushed their attempts at innovation and creativity. 

So as you see, it has nothing to do with nostalgia. Even today we can find great works of creation, as there are other channels for creative minds to express themselves. Like tv series instead of movies, indipendent games or crowdfunding instead of mainstream publishing. But as great as indipendent games are, I would always prefer that sometimes AAA publishers just threw a lot of money at the best creative of the era and told him do whatever he wants, like it used to happen in the golden age of videogames.

A. Sony is funding the game. They are a monster corporation and they don't need any money from me. Check this link from the kickstarter...

  In case you didn't want to read that full article, I'll give you the main points. Sony is helping with the production and marketing of the publishing as well. However, ALL MONEY FROM THE KICKSTARTER GOES DIRECTLY TO YS NET PURELY FOR SHENMUE 3'S DEVELOPMENT. We know Sony is funding but not how much. My greatest fear for Shenmue 3 is that the scope of the game is determined by how well the kickstarter does. What if we get a lackluster game because too many fans sat on the sidelines during the kickstarter? I know I would never forgive myself if Shenmue 3 tanks and I didn't do anything to see it succeed so early in the project. 

B. The Shenmue 3 kickstarter has already reached its $2 million goal. It doesn't need my help.

  Wrong, we need everyone's help no matter how small to make this game a success! Shenmue 3 is about $800,000 from breaking the record of highest funded videogame kickstarter ever! The current champ is Bloodstained at $5.5 million. Passing that would be great publicity for the Shenmue 3 release. More importantly, there are numerous stretch goals on the Shenmue 3 kickstarter page to expand the current scope of the game. Some of these include additional minigames, additional languages for subtitles, and larger game worlds. Simply put, the bigger the kickstarter, the bigger the game.

I will just leave you with a link on why current fans love Shenmue 3 and inform you that the cut scenes from the previous two game will be available with Shenmue 3 so you can catch up on the story. You should also know that the Shenmue creator, Yu Suzuki and Sega are in talks to release Shenmue 1 and 2 in HD, possibly for X-Box One and PS4 but that is still unclear.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",0.0,,False,8.0,False,13.0,Why you should still contribute to Shenmue 3 KickStarter.,False,"I too would occasionally Google Shenmue 3 to see if any new rumors or hard news was out there. Then this year I decided to watch the Sony E3 presentation and went absolutely bonkers when the music started playing and Shenmue 3 was announced! I've been looking forward to this game for many many years and am so happy to be a part of its creation. Basically, most of the game development funding will be from Kickstarter. Sony is helping with marketing and porting the game to their platform, which allows Suzuki to use the majority of the funds from KS to actually creating Shenmue 3.

$5 million goal, which we are very in close reach of, will allow Suzuki to create a Shenmue with ideas he's been dreaming of implementing for 14 years, these include the character perspective system (play as different characters and see their viewpoint of the situation) and rapport system (personality system for the Shenhua heroine who will change her feelings, remarks, interactions towards you depending on what you say and do with her on the quest). Hitting $7.5 million will allow for a greater expansion of the combat system, allowing it to be much more advanced than even in Shenmue 2 - fyi the combat plays a lot like Virtua Fighter. $10-11 million gives a much greater expansion of villages with mini games/side jobs that Shenmue is known for, and allows for the Magic Maze (procedural generation of the Guilin Forrest area with many more events to unfold).

If we can even only reach $7.5 million for the upgraded battle system, I think that's the stretch goal a lot of the fans would be really happy if we can hit it. It'll only happen if we can all still get support for Shenmue and hopefully attract newcomers to this series.

No pressure on anyone who doesn't want to help fund the game for their own reasons, and if you don't like Shenmue, that's cool too. Just hoping this info clears up some misconceptions about the Sony Shenmue situation with people thinking Sony is actually funding a lot of money, but they aren't. Shenmue is a great series that's had a lot of influence on modern open world game design, and many fans have been waiting for 14 years for this sequel to finally happen and they're trying to make it the best it can be. Right now we're about $2.5 million away from achieving all of the combat system upgrade stretch goals.

Thanks for any support! :)[deleted]For so long I was wanting and waiting for it to happen. As time has gone by I've lost interest in it. I looked at the Kickstarter page and I saw that if I do put money in, it'll still be another two years before its released. I'm just not sure what I'll be doing in two years as I'll probably be even less interested. If they can guarantee that the story will finally end then I'll consider it.  It would be a total bummer if they just left us hanging for another 10 years after its released before they release the next installment.Frankly if the game was so good as people claim it would has sold well enough to not need a kickstarter program and Sony would fully fund it. 

I should really just say downvote me and save the truth for myself as the result will be the same and my inbox would be empty."

I recently finished playing Hyper Light Drifter by Heart Machine, the latest indie game success story from Kickstarter. It’s easily one of the most beautiful games I’ve ever played, featuring an incredible, atmospheric soundtrack and absolutely gorgeous visuals. The project was spearheaded by lead designer Alex Preston who, interestingly enough, is an artist by trade and is only just venturing into the video game industry. His expertise in crafting worlds on a canvas is pretty obvious to anyone who plays the game, and it’s one of the reasons why Hyper Light Drifter is so unique. In an industry that uses dialogue so heavily to establish plot points and character motivations, Hyper Light Drifter is the rare exception in that there is no dialogue whatsoever. For the vast majority of the game there aren’t even recognizable words, with the only script appearing being a set of indecipherable glyphs. And yet, despite this feature, Hyper Light Drifter manages to establish a rich story and interesting characters through a combination of cut scenes and environmental storytelling. I’d argue that it has some of the best world-building of any game released in the past couple months. So what is it that Hyper Light Drifter gets so right?

I think it has a lot to do with Preston’s willingness to accept the player’s interpretation of the game. There are a number of games that have a moral message wrapped up somewhere in the plot, but many of them are similarly heavy handed in how the present this moral. The Pokémon games are a good example of this. Since the business of capturing Pokémon and keeping them in Pokéballs invites the obvious comparison to slavery, the games introduce Team Rocket as an example of how people can take advantage of Pokémon. But we are never actually given the chance to pass moral judgment on Team Rocket’s activities. They are clearly the bad guys in the story, and the player-character is always diametrically opposed to them in both a gameplay and story context. This kind of prescriptive moral designation can feel childish; it’s already obvious enough that taking advantage of Pokémon is bad, why do we need to have the antagonists run around in black uniforms and shout stereotypical villainous catch phrases to show us that they’re the bad guys? Of course, Pokémon is directed at a younger audience so some of this is purely for dramatic effect, but I think it exemplifies some of the problems with prescriptive morality that exist in many video games.

Hyper Light Drifter takes a substantially different approach in its storytelling. By leaving out words altogether, it prevents itself from telling the player anything about the world, and instead resorts purely to showing the player the world. Thus, the game refrains from providing any sort of preordained moral judgment. It gives the player space to organically explore the world and to come up with their own interpretation of the events that take place – which is exactly what someone would do if they were actually exploring this world. In this way, Hyper Light Drifter allows us to fully immerse ourselves in the environment, providing us not just with an incredible world to explore, but also with the freedom to explore it however we choose.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: This is an excerpt from a blog post - to see pictures and hyperlinks, click &lt;a href=""https://adityamrao.wordpress.com/2016/06/15/hyper-light-drifter-a-story-without-words/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Seriously. It's in nearly every game, and it is effectively time travel.In shooter games whenever you reload a gun you don't lose ammo when you drop a half loaded mag on the ground. Those rounds somehow magically get put into your next mag.

Damage on a body reduced to numbers.I'm going through Witcher 3 right now, and it's so strange that, mid battle, I can heal by chowing down on raw meat.

Another one is quick-time events, specifically in the God of War franchise. I never quite figured out why hitting the circle button translated into ripping a cyclops's eye out. Time pauses so I can see what's in all my pockets, packs, and pouches. 

Fell of a cliff and took 95 damage. Thats okay, I still have 5 HP, no broken legs, or pain. I take off running like nothing happened!

Eat a sandwich, recover from bullet wounds, knife stabs, and 3rd degree burns. Sleeping does the same thing.double or triple jumpCharacter swapping mid-game in some big adventure game (not like a choose your fighter thing). Where do these characters go when you swap them out?

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3g79ef/bbc_use_edited_thief_game_logo_for_tech_theft/Some background: On July 8th the BBC used a modified piece of Thief artwork for an article on Hackers. 

http://www.gamesradar.com/wait-did-bbc-use-thief-art-illustrate-story-about-hacker/

Turns out the image was from a stock website where someone had stolen the original, edited it and uploaded it.

On August 3rd, they did it again! Same image, edited slightly differently, this time for an article on identity theft:

http://www.bbc.co.uk/search?q=phantom%20thieves

The editing is hilarious and the irony that they're using a stolen image for articles about digital theft is delicious.Original Post referenced from /r/gaming by /u/SolarMechanic

Anyway, I ended up taking the thing and all my games to my best friend's house for a sleepover. She got really into Sonic (which I had already beaten) and wanted to beat it so I left it with her. One of her mom's junkie friends stole the fucking thing and I haven't seen it since.

Yeah, in the grand scheme of things the Dreamcast wasn't super great. But it was MINE dammit, and it was the only console Dragonriders of Pern was released for.

This is silly. Cheating is always welcome in single player games. I think it's dumb but it has a place.Often it's not that you're not good but that the designers have made a shitty level or stuck a game together after creating it in pieces and not adjusted for a difficulty curve.

In certain books I skip chapters I don't like. When I reread ASOIAF I don't read Sansas chapters as I don't like them. If I listen to music I often skip songs I don't like.

5eou0u,7.0,0.0,,,"Good afternoon, and happy thanksgiving!

My brother was a victim of a very serious accident last year that saw him put into the ICU and 5 other hospitals and rehabilitation centers. As a result of the accident, he is recovering from a traumatic brain injury that will affect him for the rest of his life, and also suffered a stroke 5 days after his accident. As a result of this stroke, it has left his right arm extremely weak and unable to move. After 13 months living in medical facilities, he just moved home 2 days ago.

Before the accident, my brother was an avid gamer, and I know a lot of games require you to use both of your hands on the controller or handheld system, and I am in a bit of a bind on what games could be playable where it isn't a necessity to have to use both hands for gameplay.

I already plan on buying him a Nintendo 3DS, as I see places are selling them for $99 for Black Friday, and I know that the Pokémon series is a set of games that are playable with just the one hand.

I was thinking maybe Mario Party 10, but I'm not sure because I have not played it, I know that he is pretty capable of playing Mario Party series for the regular Wii version because we have played Mario Party 8 and 9 (just trouble with a few select mini games, but we try to avoid those ones when we get to choose).

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",0.0,,False,5.0,False,7.0,Video games that people with paralysis in one arm can play?,False,"Looks like you don't have a computer, but Civilization would be perfect If you don't have one already, it is not a bad idea to try investing into a computer. Even your most basic computer can play a variety of games that he may enjoy, some of them are even for free. I'm going to suggest some types of games for him to play, and then you can ask him what kinds of stuff he enjoys, and you can refine your choices from there.

The first type of games I would recommend you trying are Visual Novels. These can be considered books in video game format, often with a choose your own adventure style. Visual Novels are widely story-telling games, and just as you can find any genre of book, you can find a Visual Novel for any genre you like. Some I can recommend are Katawa Shoujo (though as this game is about disabled high schoolers, it may be a bit too soon, though this one is free), Long Live the Queen (very hard game to beat), Hatoful Boyfriend (pigeon dating simulator, so he may get a laugh out of this), Higurashi (a horror visual novel and has an anime adaptation), and Clannad (dating simulator, and also has an anime adaptation, and though I haven't played this one, its apparently rather good).

The second type of games I can recommend are strategy games, though it may be difficult to find ones that are suited to the one-handed experience. The Civilization series is a good one to do (though very addicting), and I remember Faster than Light being manageable with one hand, but outside of those two, it may be a little rough finding good ones that don't require too many keys to play. With these kinds of games look for turn based strategy games above all else, though some of the non-turn based ones will be point and click, and therefore pretty manageable with only one hand.

The third type of games are Role Playing Games with turn-based combat. Of course this includes Pokemon, and I will recommend some other system-specific ones below, but not a lot of big PC titles use this format anymore, and the only ones that I can think of for the PC that he may enjoy would be Child of Light and Undertale. I especially recommend Undertale as it is a critical darling and just a very solid game.

Lastly I can recommend simulator-style games. The poster child of these kinds of games would be The Sims series, but it also includes titles such as Animal Crossing, and Stardew Valley. These games are largely lifestyle and resource management, and therefore can be taken at a much slower pace as he needs. Though this can include particular oddities like Papers Please, which I remember being pretty manageable one-handed, and is basically a Soviet border patrol simulator.

Also seeing as I am a big Nintendo fan, some games that you can find for the 3DS that would be ideal for your brother's situation would be, any of the Fire Emblem games, any of the Professor Layton games, any of the Phoenix Wright games, 999, any of the Pokemon games obviously, Bravely Default, Animal Crossing, Chrono Trigger and most ordinary DS titles. A lot of Nintendo DS games relied on the touch screen for movement and combat so I think that he could even play Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass on that 3DS.

As for the PS4... The only game that I think that he might be able to play is Until Dawn, and even then... I don't know...

In any case, I sincerely hope that this helps in some capacity, and that you can find some gems that he will genuinely like!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGKiV_f4ixg

Do what makes you happy.I hate that people think gaming is such a horrible thing. I played video games daily from the time I was 8 to current. It became a safe place to avoid abuse and helped me connect with new people and friends. My family would make fun of me but I didnt care many people for a time thought i would be a no body living with my parents the rest of my life. It did get better once i went to college. As long as (once you are old enough) you have a job and then eventually can pay for your own place fewer people will care that you game. Have no shame for gaming or being different, and flip to those that are so small they need to demean others to feel good. I had a lot of trouble with my parents and most of my family when I was young due to videogames, I used to respond in anger that ""they spent so much time on the TV why were they bothering me about the computer?"" but that would only get them angrier / get me grounded, or it would have no effect at all. I ended up figuring out that the best way to shut them up is to show something you've done using that medium, and I don't mean ""look at this 360 noscope compilation I made"" but more like ""look mom I can code!"" and show them a little game you've made, or ""look I can make music"" and show them some digital music that you've made, or anything else that requires a computer and some skill. Show them something that will give them an idea that you might have a chance at a job doing whatever it is you like doing and that will get them to back down, if it doesn't...


**Story time!**

I used to be at a point in my life where you are now, not going into too much detail because I don't feel like creating a throwaway account and I'd probably give so much specific information that if someone who knows me read it, they'd probably know it was about me. Anyway, I used to play A LOT of videogames, I had my mind set on being a videogame designer / programmer since I was 10 but getting that job in my country is probably as common as getting hit by lightning, as most videogame companies around here are start-ups that for the most part don't last many years.

Against all odds, I did manage to get myself into a Videogame Design course and 3 years later I was among the top of my (year) class and landed a job at one of those start-ups right out of college. It took a lot of family fights, me vs them kinda stuff, depression, suicidal thoughts and so on... but I proved my point and managed to study what I wanted without my family interfering. In retrospective, I was really fucked up in the head back then.

Out of college, I was working as an intern earning minimum wage which for my parents only proved I hadn't amounted to anything after all, I was considered ""lower class"" basically. I had to count my money at all times, ration meals when necessary and I couldn't afford new clothes, entertainment (like going out, movies, new games, etc...). Couple of years later the company filed for bankrupcy and I found myself without a job (which again, seemed to prove their point even more) and I didn't have any spare money, ended up living with my grandparents for a while as it was either that or become homeless (I was stubborn enough that I wouldn't ask my parents for money).

Spent 5 months looking for a job and finally landed it working as a contractor for a U.S. based company earning a high 5-figure salary as a game programmer, overnight I went from being borderline poor as fuck to earning more each month than I could spend in that same month given my spending habits and the cost of living over here (of course if I wanted to I could spend all my money, I mean mostly living and entertainment expenses like buying food, water, snacks, paying mortgage, buying new games on release and so on). Not bad at all for someone who's in the beginning years of their career and excellent considering that judging by the salaries in my country I'm considered ""upper class"" now.

To me personally it's not about the money, I do it because I love it and getting paid well is a very nice bonus, the money is just great to prove them wrong though, because other people will judge how successful you are by how much you earn and not only did I get a well-paying job doing what I love, I got it in a country where that seemed impossible to happen (both the chances of getting a job in the industry and it being well paid).

There's not much advice I can give you, I was never good at giving advice / knew what to say. Thought a success story would do you good though, if I could be stubborn enough to make it and prove them wrong so can you OP. Believe in yourself and don't let anyone tell you otherwise, of course this doesn't mean ""be a leech and live off your parents without doing shit"", but don't let them tell you what you should or should not become and what your hobbies should be, as long as you're happy and you're not bothering anyone else but yourself. Try at all costs to take the ""pacifist route"" but if that doesn't work then just be stubborn and do what you love.It sounds to me like you need counseling, both for the challenges you're facing in life and for help communicating to others the importance video games play in your life. The fact is, it's not healthy to live your entire life through video games and it is not a long term solution, but it also can be a great outlet and a ray of joy and an outlet in an otherwise difficult life. From my experience, video games will eventually give you less and less pleasure in life as well. If you can find ways through counseling and medication to overcome your anxiety and other issues and make some close friends, go to college for something that really interests you, etc., you will find a lot more joy in life. Having said that, understand too that it's not wrong to be the type of person that doesn't like to play sports and prefers to have a few close friends.

I guess my advice is, you can find a lot more joy in life and find better ways to handle these problems from professional help rather than Reddit. Don't feel ashamed of it either. Tons of people I know have had professional help at one point or another and been on medication to help, including myself, and everyone of them admits they were much better off for it. My life is so much better because I finally was willing to go to a little counseling, and I don't have near the problems many others have.

Last, it sounds like your parents don't know what's going on in your life and your mental and emotional state. They definitely don't understand why you play games. It might be helpful to sit them down and open up entirely to them. If they are really the type of people that would mock you after that, just accept they are not willing to listen and thus can't be trusted to understand and are poor sources of support and don't internalize what they say. Since they are poor ""mirrors"", don't base your self confidence off of what they say.

If you have any questions or more info, let me know and I'd be happy to talk more. Maybe you don't have a lot of people that care, but I do care. I can relate and it sucks the situation you're in.Not sure how young you are, but doing well in school IS amounting to something already. Don't worry about the video games. I've played video games my entire life. I'm almost 33, still play video games all the time, and am married to a beautiful woman and have a high-paying job in a beautiful city. Focus on enjoying life and doing what you love, and eventually you'll find your place in the world. Sorry your parents are being difficult.I just want to say that you wrote my biography. I can't really offer much advice than to ignore them and do what makes you happy. :)Sincerely, the people around you seems like the real problem. You need to find people you're happy with ASAP or you will get incredibly depressed."

It sucks balls.

But we see in the show many times when characters, both hero and villain, attempt to take out an enemy with a desperate flurry of small, minor ki blasts.  It happened so often that Piccolo took advantage of this against Android 17 by utilizing a whole ton of small, minor blasts that he kept control of and used after they ""missed"" their target(Hellzone Grenade).

That said, I agree they need to be taken out.  The only thing they serve to do is increase difficulty artificially.  If they really want to keep them around they need to(read as: I wish they would) either remove or reduce the hit stun they cause.  "

Sounds cheesy but the gameplay is addicting. Man a spaceship and successfully pilot, shield, and attack. If you're looking for a party games, the Jackbox Party Boxes are pretty good. I also would recommend Overcooked. It's a strangely fun coop cooking game. Lots of laughs as you watch menial tasks become mountains in the face of your own incompetence. Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is also a fun one. You and few friends are the crew of a ship trying to save love. Weird premise but pretty fun game play.

I prepared a little information pack for you all concerning the above request and unravel some of the mystery of my last post (sorry, never done this before lol)

A few weeks ago I was approached by a company called MoGi, who asked me to take part and be a key member in something they called “an exciting adventure in the world of YouTube streaming”.

I only have a small channel and unfortunately, I also have a full time job and so cannot take up the mantle of this challenge =) I was then asked if I had any friends who may be interested so I asked my close buddies and none of them have a passion to dive into the world of YouTube as a career.

Their guy that contacted me said that “A recent addition MoGi added to their services is centered around a localization initiative for indie developers and small companies to take their games to audiences around the world!“ which sounds pretty cool to me! After some digging, I see they do some interesting stuff (like voice overs) and their website shows some fun games on the main page too! 

I don’t know toooo much, only that it’s a new operation and so it means starting from the ground and working up. I guess it also means that you get free game keys to test out things too, which is always a plus ^^ 

If you wana check it out, then you can find more information about them from their website (and some of the games they work on too) here: http://www.mogi-translations.com/ 

If you are interested, I would be happy to share the contact details with the guy that contacted me! ^ Send me a PM and I can will give you as much info as I have : )

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know toooo much, only that it’s a new operation and so it means starting from the ground and working up. I guess it also means that you get free game keys to test out things too, which is always a plus &lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wana check it out, then you can find more information about them from their website (and some of the games they work on too) here: &lt;a href=""http://www.mogi-translations.com/""&gt;http://www.mogi-translations.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested, I would be happy to share the contact details with the guy that contacted me! ^ Send me a PM and I can will give you as much info as I have : )&lt;/p&gt;

I recently played a game called The Beginner's Guide and it really surprised me in a good way. The game was different, interesting and it had a certain level of depth.

Fez

Braid

Her Story

Firewatch

Flower / Journey

To The Moon""The last of us"" is an excellent game for this type of taste. You go through an amazing story, just in video game form. 

Undertale is another good one. It has SNES graphics but the twist on the game play is unique. By the end of the game you are emotionally invested. You want to play NaissanceE. The adventure takes place in a primitive mysterious structure and the game mainly consists to explore and it is very ""deep""
Try MystUntil Dawn breaks the mold of video games.  More of an interactive horror movie than a typical video game.  I like quirky games and indie games so I will try to recommend a few that I enjoyed, based on what you described. If anyone wants to suggest more that I would like too then please do :)

Antichamber: A weird puzzle game with puzzles similar to Portal. Frustrating sometimes but nice to play and explore.

Broken Age: Because you said ""art"", this game is hand painted and looks really cool. Nice story, although I have only finished Chapter 1. A couple of cool celebrity voices too.

Dear Ester: Short but pretty story game.

Goat Simulator: I debated leaving this out because it's just such a ridiculous game, but since you like WoW, try the MMO simulator on it, there's some funny easter eggs in there. 

Jazzpunk: Surreal story and puzzle game. I had loads of fun playing it. However it is a little short (4 hours approx) so maybe try catch it on sale.

Little Inferno: Setting stuff on fire is fun. Simple story game with a little challenge behind it (but pretty easy). Sort of comically dark, if that makes sense.

Minecraft: Maybe an obvious one to try if you haven't? You said you like painting, how about building?

The Stanley Parable: I don't want to say anything because it would spoil it. But I loved this game. It was one of the reasons I quit my office job.

World Of Goo: I played this on my phone but I think it's made by the same company as Little Inferno. Weird but charming puzzle game. I still haven't finished it though. Axiom Verge -  Weird Metroid style game that I still haven't really decoded. 

Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons - This game truly merged narrative with game play and mechanics. Great game. 

Undertale - I know that many people have mixed feelings about this game, but it is something you should experience yourself. I, personally, am a huge fan. 

Spec Ops: The Line - Looks like a generic shooter. Plays like a generic shooter. Narrative that makes you have an existential crisis. 

Braid - Challenging puzzle game that looks like art, and reads like a poem written in a dream. A dream about nukes, obsession, and princesses. 

Stanley Parable - The shortest game you will never truly beat. 
""Papers, Please"" is one of the few video games that actually hit me emotionally and I thought about my actions after I was done playing.Stardew Valley seems to be winning people over for depth of characters and storyline.
Eve Online has plenty of backstory and lore to read and can be played anyway you want to play it.Metal gear solid fits the bill I've gone on about the Metal Gear Solid Series already but here are some other recommendations if you want to play some fun games that also have a bit more going on beneath the surface level.

* Hotline Miami (not immediatly apperant, but be patient and you'll see)
* Bioshock Infinite (avoid the DLC though)
* Killer 7 (warning: severely weird and almost indecipherable if you don't bring some knowledge about the stuff the game ends up commenting on)
* The Last Of Us (actually very typical post-apocalyptic fiction most of the time, but quite elaborate character building and an ending that stands among one of my favorites in any kind of fiction)
* SOMA
* Papers, Please
* Cart Life

And since you seem to like Point &amp; Click Adventures, the games by Wadjet Eye are generally worth a look into for compelling stories with some thought behind them.Deus ex human revolution "

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, for the first time in a long time, I will buy a game on release day.  It is amazing how much can change in just a few years.  I feel like an entirely different person.  Tomorrow I will fire up my XBOX One, load up Fallout 4, and remember what it is like to be a kid again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough rambling, how much has all of your lives changed in the past 7 years?&lt;/p&gt;

Salutations:

I could start by saying how much I like your company and it's products, but that's not what this is about.

This is about a vision -- a goal -- a dream, if you will. I'd encourage this to be read in it's entirety, but I know that's a luxury. Skip to the “IN SUMMARY” and “THE IDEA” parts clearly marked below, if desired.

---===  BODY ===---

There are two things I want to point out first and they are the following:

1) Today, we live in a world that's constantly becoming smaller and smaller primarily through technological advances. It's becoming so commonplace that even two-year-olds have access to and can operate a smart phone proficiently enough to navigate and play their favorite games. This results in less need for actual individual and physical toys.

2) Even I find myself, after having obtained a new LEGO kit, building aforementioned LEGO kit only to admire it and set it on a shelf. I'm too afraid of losing pieces and/or possibly even damaging one. This results in an almost complete loss of any desire, inspiration, and/or initiative I may have had to disassemble it in an effort to create something else. Why is this? For me, LEGOs have become almost like a piece of nostalgia. I have a lot of memories playing with LEGOs, and it seems like more of a collector's piece to me. At this point, it loses the ""sandbox creation"" feeling often associated with building with LEGOs.

In those two paragraphs, I lightly touch based on dozens of key points I'd like to discuss; however, in an effort to keep this concise, I will simply only mention a few.

I asked myself the following common questions with which I'm sure millions of people would relate and/or agree with my answers:

What has changed in the last 20 years?
With what do I most often associate with LEGOs?
What do I use to satisfy my desire to design, build, and create?

To sum up the answer to these questions, look at Minecraft (http://www.minecraft.net/), Cube World (https://www.picroma.com/cubeworld), and even EVE Online (http://www.eveonline.com/).

Again, without going into too much lengthy detail; I understand that LEGO Group has had dealings in many games. Most of which were not very successful. I did not research this any, but I'm willing to bet that some of the most successful were the LEGO Star Wars, LEGO Indiana Jones, and LEGO Harry Potter series of games. They're primarily just action/adventure games with a fun twist and a lot of mini accomplishments that can be acquired along the way. These games are great. I own most all of them and have played them quite thoroughly. Why are they so great? Because they attract such a wide variety of age groups. I've seen countless people varying from 3-60+ years of age enjoy these games time and time again.

In contrast, when LEGO Universe was announced, I and many others could not wait to play. It was one of those “hurry up and take my money!” things. I had high hopes that it would be the LEGO Creator game I always dreamed of; however, I was severely disappointed to see it was so blatantly geared towards small children and just rather “clunky” to play. I suffered through playing it for a week before canceling my subscription.

Of course, we can't forget about DESIGN byME aka Lego Factory which is now just the “LEGO Digital Designer” application along with the option to upload creations to a publicly viewable online gallery. DESIGN byME was an awesome service, and I was saddened to see it go.


---===  IN SUMMARY  ===---

So, what do we take away from this horrible ramble of stringed together thoughts?

LEGO provides products which attract individuals of all ages and therefore needs a product and/or service that can be marketed to all ages.

Aforementioned product and/or service needs to bring LEGO fans together by means of latest technological advances.

Needs to have a “sandbox” feel to it with limitless possibilities. Write your own story as you play.


---===  THE IDEA  ===---

Start with what we know. People love to build and create with LEGOs. What keeps them coming back for more? A sense of accomplishment. Achievements.

Develop a game which revolves around collecting, resource gathering, building, manufacturing, build-able and fully customizable in-game factories, and creating in a sandbox environment that never ends. Make it so that every block placed is an incredible sense of accomplishment. Make it multiplayer. Private servers, public servers, singleplayer, creative mode. Keep it simple to start. Slowly introduce more and more options, features, and possibilities. Later implement LEGO Mindstorms into the endless list of possibilities.

It doesn't need a big story line or plot. Keep it simple. Stories dictate and are typically focused towards different age groups. Think LEGOs. Unlimited.

Ultimately, it could be used to drive actual sales of LEGO products. Implement an option to select a specific section of blocks, generate a list of LEGO blocks used within that section, and link it to a product list of purchasable goods shipped directly to your doorstep and ready for your construction.

Do you know what I and many others would give to be able to easily and conveniently purchase the parts necessary to build in real life what I've already created digitally in our Minecraft servers? A lot.

Ultimately, you have a huge fan base, and LEGO has been around long enough to be fondly remembered in the minds of all ages – Use that.

Simply announcing it will create a lot of buzz. Make it one-time purchase only – micro transactions are more profitable. I've got ideas for that, but another time, possibly. Make it purchasable in “Alpha” stage of development for cheap to help minimize initial investment costs before seeing any return, and also to help create buzz and receive player feedback from those who will best represent the player-base. As it progresses through “Beta” and final releases, the cost eventually goes to full price.

From a development standpoint and coming from someone with experience in game design and development, what I have in mind would only take a handful of talented individuals to accomplish. I've already started work because, as is with LEGOs, I love to see my ideas become creations in reality.


BONUS IDEA

Take a look at what's coming out later this month. It's called Leap Motion (https://www.leapmotion.com/). It basically has the ability to detect hand and individual finger motions. Currently, it's unprecedented. Imagine having a LEGO design “app” which takes advantage of utilizing this type of technology. You could literally have a bucket full of LEGOs which are randomly generated, dump out the individual LEGO pieces in a digital environment using your own hands, shift through and select individual pieces with your fingers, and create with seemingly random pieces provided you. The possibilities are limitless.


Sincerely,
___________

With a set up talking about a bleak and grim future after a zombie apocalypse. And yet, when the trailer played, it didn't resemble any of that. Besides many other obvious issues, some might ask too, what happened?

Well we're here to tell you about that. A few of us ex-Robotoki ""family"" members (that's what Robert Bowling, the CEO/creative director/producer/art director/Head of HR/PR rep/Transmedia Lead likes to refer to everyone at the company as.) are here to tell you about how this is, and hopefully, steer any talent away from this toxic studio.
Talking about Robotoki can be a mix bag of emotions. On one hand, the studio promises the ideas of building a small team, making ambitious projects, a sense of community (plus royalties and stock options, which for obvious reasons, have never materialized.), company trips to go kart or Six Flags. Some of the people are (were) genuinely talented and wanted to make something special.

On the other hand, it's an incredibly dysfunctional organization that has no real chain of command other than Robert. Some individuals seem to really only be interested in power and political climbing, rather than doing their jobs and making an actual game.

Ultimately, the problem lies with Robert himself. He runs and supervises everything. No one to question or check him (even though the company, at one time anyways, believed in having open and honest discussions. That stopped when people became open about not being confident in Robert.). For those who might not be familiar with how successful studios work, this is typically not the case. In fact it's almost improbable. You'll have a chain of command and structure to tasks and schedules. There is none of that, at least officially. The whole company is at the whim of a man who, we all learned in time, had no real development experience actually making a game. Sure he was on Call of Duty teams, but he was never in the trenches with the people who actually made the games.
Trying to figure out Robert Bowling can be a very complex things. Early on, he was someone who genuinely seemed to care about each individual person, and always willing to do after hours activities with departments or individuals. On the other side though, he is ultimately a deceiver and a liar. In which case, makes that first part even worse. This is a man who bought 2 brand new cars, weeks before laying off people. This is the same guy who would take employees to strip clubs, give them money to spend and that same week, say there was no room in the budget for things pertinent to the actual company that cost less than $20.

He would routinely layoff people at random it seemed, or people who did not drink his kool aid. If you spoke out against or questioned an idea of his (and oh boy did this guy have a laundry list or 5 of ideas he needed to implement almost on a daily basis), they would usually shortly be gone. He would promote someone one week and lay them off the next, giving ambiguous reasons each time as to why.

A presumed close friend of his at Infinity Ward, left that company to come start up Robotoki with him. After he began to not agree with the direction of the company, he ended up firing him and another employee. And oh yeah, how did this dear friend of his hear about it? From the other employee who was also fired, before the guy even showed up to work. Robert would routinely want to integrate elements from whatever movie or tv show he had recently watched into the game, without any process to think through how that would effect the overall vision of the game.

While a lot of the blame can and should be laid at Robert's feet, it cant all be. The best way to describe the way decisions were made on Human Element, involved whoever yelled the loudest or was the most aggressive. There were not one but TWO incidents of physical altercations at the company. Which is incredibly rare in this industry. One guy in particular, who was hired to be a lead only lasted a month after he got grabbed someone under him by the shirt and yelled ""DO YOU WANT TO HIT ME?"" in front of his whole department. In that same department, one individual, who is still there, would routinely spout sexiest and rape jokes and statements, while sitting a few desks over from female employees.

Now some might have seen that Nexon had a publishing deal with Robotoki recently that they ""mutually"" cut off. 

Well that isn't totally true....

The studio was not meeting the quality standards that Nexon required, on top of that Nexon also had been witnessed to seeing employees, who should have been working on HEO (Human Element Online), instead working on other internal projects Nexon was not funding. This is kind of a big no no in the industry. The split would have eventually happened regardless. Nexon was not happy at all.

When the recent round of layoffs came, a lot of people were scratching their heads. How come we spent tens of thousands of dollars for a GIANT FUCKING ROBOT ARM to act as a conference table that didnt even work as a table? Why was he buying decorative things around the office like giant Iron Man and Mario statues? We thought we were indie? And honestly, we all should have known it was fishy to begin with when he hired his own wife to run the human resources department (a la Dyack, cause that worked out real well too.) How come we had to switch engines a year out before release?

There are plenty of other stories out there if anyone (and journalists in particular) want to find out about that are either too personal about other employees or we just dont have solid enough version to post on here. These are just some of the stories we all witnessed. The studio currently has a skeleton crew that are all handling outsourcing at the moment to try to finish this game next year.

Stay away from this studio, if you're in the industry. Plenty of us that have worked there have been hurt either professionally, personally or financially working here. We all came in believing in the idea of making something special, not just as a game, but as a studio. Who knows if that has ever been the real goal ultimately.

If mods would like to verify who we are, we can gladly send proof.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of you who were watching The Game Awards tonight, got a glimpse of Human Element. Maybe some of you had heard about it before. With a set up talking about a bleak and grim future after a zombie apocalypse. And yet, when the trailer played, it didn&amp;#39;t resemble any of that. Besides many other obvious issues, some might ask too, what happened?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well we&amp;#39;re here to tell you about that. A few of us ex-Robotoki &amp;quot;family&amp;quot; members (that&amp;#39;s what Robert Bowling, the CEO/creative director/producer/art director/Head of HR/PR rep/Transmedia Lead likes to refer to everyone at the company as.) are here to tell you about how this is, and hopefully, steer any talent away from this toxic studio.
Talking about Robotoki can be a mix bag of emotions. On one hand, the studio promises the ideas of building a small team, making ambitious projects, a sense of community (plus royalties and stock options, which for obvious reasons, have never materialized.), company trips to go kart or Six Flags. Some of the people are (were) genuinely talented and wanted to make something special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it&amp;#39;s an incredibly dysfunctional organization that has no real chain of command other than Robert. Some individuals seem to really only be interested in power and political climbing, rather than doing their jobs and making an actual game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the problem lies with Robert himself. He runs and supervises everything. No one to question or check him (even though the company, at one time anyways, believed in having open and honest discussions. That stopped when people became open about not being confident in Robert.). For those who might not be familiar with how successful studios work, this is typically not the case. In fact it&amp;#39;s almost improbable. You&amp;#39;ll have a chain of command and structure to tasks and schedules. There is none of that, at least officially. The whole company is at the whim of a man who, we all learned in time, had no real development experience actually making a game. Sure he was on Call of Duty teams, but he was never in the trenches with the people who actually made the games.
Trying to figure out Robert Bowling can be a very complex things. Early on, he was someone who genuinely seemed to care about each individual person, and always willing to do after hours activities with departments or individuals. On the other side though, he is ultimately a deceiver and a liar. In which case, makes that first part even worse. This is a man who bought 2 brand new cars, weeks before laying off people. This is the same guy who would take employees to strip clubs, give them money to spend and that same week, say there was no room in the budget for things pertinent to the actual company that cost less than $20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He would routinely layoff people at random it seemed, or people who did not drink his kool aid. If you spoke out against or questioned an idea of his (and oh boy did this guy have a laundry list or 5 of ideas he needed to implement almost on a daily basis), they would usually shortly be gone.

Our goal is to play through as many DC Comic related video games in the 72 hour period, while doing some fun stuff along the way. This is our 12th marathon, and we have raised over $10,000 during those previous marathons combined! I am hoping to take it to another level this time around, hence why we've come to Reddit.

The charity for the marathon will be The Brain and Behavior Research Fund, who are dedicated to giving grants to scientists around the world to help treat, diagnose, and cure mental illness in all forms. Mental Illness affects just about everyone in one way or another, if not through themselves than through a friend, partner, or parent. It's something that hits very close to home for my own family and even myself. Mental Illness covers a huge amount of diseases and issues from Bipolar, Schizophrenia, Depression, Autism, Suicide and many more.

As for the games and other fun stuff, we are doing an Injustice Tournament amongst the members here at Bonus Stage, in addition to the main story of the single player mode.

We will be doing a chat interactive run of Scribblenauts Unmasked, where the chat will be able to suggest the items we use to beat the game.

Upon reaching a certain donation goal, I will be doing Superman 64 in full."" - Cornshaq
